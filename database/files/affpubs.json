        "description": "<p>ABSTRACT: Many shorebirds feed on macrobenthic fauna that become available at low tide in coastal intertidal flats. Waders differ in the method used to search for food. This paper presents results of a study on the feeding behaviour, diet and energetic needs of oystercatchers and grey plovers at the Bay of Heist, Belgium, using focal bird observations and macrobenthos sampling. The two bird species differed in their success rate and foraging rate but not in their foraging efficiency. Oystercatchers spent 70.2 % of time for handling mussels and 28.6 % for worms whereas grey plovers spent 93.3 % of the time for handling worms. During the whole period of observation, 75.5% and 42.5% of prey were identified for oystercatchers and grey plovers, respectively. Of these, polychaete worms comprised 51.3% and mussels 23.4% of oystercatchers prey, and worms 41.2% of grey plovers&acute; prey. For both species of birds, the overall size of prey estimated was significantly correlated with the corresponding biomass (worms R2 = 0.97; mussels, R2 = 0.99). Oystercatchers obtained a total of 158.8KJ daily energy intake from mussels, worms, and grey plovers 2.37 KJ from worms only. Mussels comprised an important contribution to the total energy intake of oystercatchers and worms for the grey plovers. Habitat partitioning between the two species of birds was not observed.</p>",

This article argues that the Congo Basin Forest Partnership (CBFP) is an example of governance that aims to match the complexity of the governance challenge with a form of organisation that copes better with complexity, namely the network. It traces both the general change in governance theory and the way it has played out in the forestry sector specifically.

        "description": "<p>Across Africa, national policies that established protected areas (PAs) typically limited local use of wildlife and other resources. Over time, these policies have raised tensions with rural communities and today threaten to undermine conservation goals. This article examines community&ndash;PA relationships at four important sites in Ethiopia&mdash;a country of rich tradition with an unusual colonial past. Using focus groups and household surveys, we found that despite local tensions, most respondents held positive views toward wildlife and nearby PAs. Factors influencing positive views included receiving PA benefits, good relations with PA staff, higher education levels, being older, having a large family, diversified income sources, owning fewer livestock, and fewer incidents of wildlife conflicts. In contrast, the devolved control of PAs from federal to regional levels has not influenced community&ndash;PA relations as intended. Our results suggest that relations could be improved through involving communities in co-management arrangements, honoring resource tenure and use rights, providing benefits, and implementing conservation education programs.

Such &ldquo;community-resource&rdquo; linkages are particularly important in Alaska, where rural communities &ndash; many of them comprised of indigenous Alaskan Natives &ndash; are highly dependent upon local resources found on public lands. Alaskan communities utilize forests in many ways. To better understand these coupled &ldquo;social-ecological&rdquo; systems, we combined socio-economic data from the 2000 U.S. Census with timber permit data from the USDA Forest Service to describe communities and their use of forest resources. Our results suggest that private access to public resources is an important feature of Alaskan communities, and that continued access is likely to be a key factor in sustaining human systems on the landscape. As a result, public land managers should give special consideration to local resource use when making policy decisions.

        "description": "East African montane forests have been subjected to heavy logging, particularly of Ocotea usambarensis Engl., formerly one of the dominant tree species of moist mid-altitude forests. At Mt. Kenya, logging was suspended in 2000 after a conspicuous decline in population size, but the success of this conservation measure has not yet been evaluated. Given that a management scheme of O. usambarensis forests based on vegetative regeneration has been suggested, we hypothesized that natural regeneration mainly by root suckers would be sufficient for a recovery of this species. Demography and regeneration (both sexual and vegetative) of O. usambarensis were studied in 45 study plots between 1700 and 2500 m asl\r\nalong a gradient of historical logging intensity, while taking altitude and light incidence into account as predictor variables. The diameter distribution showed a high percentage of old individuals and rather low recruitment in O. usambarensis. In heavily logged areas (removed basal area >25 m2ha\u00021), smaller trees (<50 cm DBH, >130 cm high) were completely absent. The number of seedlings was low and independent of logging intensity. It increased with higher light incidence. The number of root suckers was 5.6-fold the number of seedlings, underscoring the importance of vegetative reproduction. However, number of root suckers and logging intensity were negatively correlated. We conclude that regeneration of O. usambarensis at Mt. Kenya is generally low and negatively influenced by historical logging. Therefore, natural regeneration is inadequate for the recovery of this valuable timber species, and additional conservation measures such as enrichment planting should be considered.",

        "description": "Conservation agriculture with trees (CAWT) is an approach that combines conservation agriculture (CA) practices with those of agroforestry. One of the knowledge gaps that must be addressed to fully exploit the potential of CAWT pertains to policies favouring or discouraging its adoption among small scale farmers. The study hypothesized that disincentives exist more than incentives in existing policies for the promotion of CAWT among small scale farmers in Kenya. We identified policy incentives and disincentives promoting or hindering large scale adoption of CAWT among small-scale farmers in Kenya by reviewing six agricultural policies related to CAWT. In addition, 26 national level government officials and technical people were interviewed and 120 small-scale farmers were surveyed in Kibwezi and Meru Countries in Eastern Kenya. We found that policy compliance by farmers was influenced by direct personal benefits derived from adopting the policies rather than the external motivations that policy incentives provide. Furthermore, policies are often poorly implemented or not exclusively targeted to small scale farmers. Farmers believe that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcindirect enabling incentives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 such as provision of improved extension services, security of land tenure and market development could offer the best motivation for them to adopt CAWT.",

        "description": "<p>Farm forestry has proved to be an important enterprise for small- and large-scale farmers worldwide. It has the potential of improving forest/tree cover across the globe. In Kenya, the forest cover is less than 2%. The country envisions achieving 10% forest cover over the next decade through promotion of farm forestry. However, the decision to plant trees on farmers&rsquo; land could be difficult. The study aimed to analyze the determinants of tree retention on farm for improvement of forest cover. Stratified and simple random sampling techniques were used in selecting 209 farmers. The results showed that sites, land size, age, education level, monthly income, tree management, extension services, availability of markets, harvesting regulation, and aesthetic and environmental motivation were significant determinants of tree retention. In particular, the chances of farmers who had gained technical skills in tree management were about 2.2 times higher to retain trees as compared to those who had not acquired such skills. Similarly, chances of farmers motivated to plant trees for environmental conservation were about 3.5 times higher to retain trees as compared to the group of farmers planting trees as a source of livelihood. These determinants would be instrumental in strengthening the current policies and reforms in forestry and agricultural sectors to enable Kenya to achieve 10% of forest cover.</p>",

        "description": "This study was undertaken in Kiambu, Thika and Maragwa districts of Central Kenya and it aimed at developing micro-level wood energy plan that would act as a case study for future decentralized wood energy plans in Kenya. Primary data was collected from households, service/production institutions comprising of factories/industries, schools, restaurants, hospitals and prisons using structured questionnaires. The study established a deficit between supply and demand balance of -41.7, -45.6 and -50.1% of woodfuel in 2006 for Kiambu, Thika and Maragwa districts respectively. The strategies suggested in micro-level wood energy plans to curb these deficits include allocation of gazetted plantation forest to fuel wood production, increase of improved stove technology, increase of on-farm tree land area and use of alternative energy sources. The combination of all these strategies gave a\r\nsurplus of 22,903, 46,947 and 32,409 tons of woodfuel in Kiambu, Thika and Maragwa districts, respectively by 2018. The study recommended implementation of the identified strategies aimed at reducing the huge deficit between supply and demand, enhancing inter-institutional collaboration in all sectors related to wood energy development, developing clear policies to guide charcoal and firewood production and marketing and having regular wood energy surveys.",

        "description": "This study was carried out in Kiambu, Thika and Maragwa districts of Central Kenya. Its objective was to analyze household energy sources and utilization technologies used. Primary data was collected from households using structured and non structured questionnaires. Trees on farm were found to be the major supply of the woodfuel energy where firewood was the main source of household energy followed by charcoal. Traditional three stones stoves were the most commonly used with 76 59 and 65 (household respondents) in Kiambu, Thika and Maragwa districts respectively. Improved charcoal\r\nstoves were the second commonly used while only a very negligible percentage used kerosene stoves and gas burners. Over 70% of the respondents were aware of the improved stoves but their adoption was less than 29%. The low adoption of improved stoves was due to their high cost as noted by the respondents. Over 90% of the households had the opinion that woodfuel sources were decreasing and there was a need to develop strategies for its future sustainability. The study recommended integration of woodfuel production to local farming systems and establishment of fuelwood plantations by Kenya\r\nForest Service to substitute on farm sources. It also recommended promotion of improved stoves with higher efficiency to reduce the woodfuel used as well as improve on environmental pollution.",

        "description": "The objective of this study was to assess household tree planting for fuelwood production and investigate current constraints to tree establishment in Kiambu, Thika and Maragwa Districts of Central Kenya. The study was undertaken through household survey in Kiambu, Thika and Maragwa Districts of Central Kenya. The districts were purposively sampled on the basis of various factors which include diverse ecological conditions and population densities among others. Sampling of the households was done using multistage stratified random sampling technique where stratification was based on the weights in socio-economic and climatic activities as indicators. The results of the study showed that over 90% of the households in the three districts have planted trees in their farms and tree planting was found to be positively correlated to household farm size. Boundary tree planting was the most preferred as compared to woodlots which had the least preference. Grevillea robusta and Eucalyptus species were the most preferred tree species. Inadequate land was the leading major obstacles to tree planting in the three districts with 74, 60 and 57% of the household respondents followed by scarcity of seedlings with 16, 33 and 28% in Kiambu, Thika and Maragwa districts, respectively. The third most important constraint was tree establishment cost. The household land size ownership varied among the districts with a range of 1.9 to 3.6 acres. The small household land holdings indicate the need to integrate woodfuel production with farming systems as agricultural sector has a key role in supplementing wood production. The study was concluded by recommending development of decentralised woodfuel planning with site specific implementation strategies in the study area as there were varying tree planting parameters among the districts. Establishment of tree nurseries was also recommended for a sustainable seedling production",

        "description": "On-farm tree planting projects in Africa can lead to sustainable development and at the same time contribute to the global effort to stabilize Greenhouse Gases (GHG) levels in the atmosphere. Trees can provide sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the carbon credit accruing from such programs can be used to offset carbon emissions in industrialized countries whose emission levels have been capped. Many countries in Africa have met the requirements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for hosting forestry projects under Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). A\r\nstudy was carried out in Kenya to assess whether the smallholder tree farmers are capable of participating in carbon-offset projects. The study established that opportunities exist for smallholder tree farmers to incorporate carbon offset as a tree product and participate in CDM and Voluntary Carbon Offset (VCO) markets. Currently farmers have been able to stock on average 11.23 tons of carbon per farm with a market value of US$ 224.. There exist networks in form of co-operatives and farmers groups which farmers can use to market\r\ntheir carbon stock.",

        "description": "<p>The study was conducted in rural and urban areas of selected&nbsp;States in Southwest Nigeria to evaluate households&rsquo; domestic&nbsp;energy carriers and consumption pattern, and implications of such&nbsp;on the welfare of the people. Structured questionnaires were&nbsp;administered to women who are responsible for cooking in the<br />households. The identified energy carriers in the study areas&nbsp;include kerosene (45.0%), firewood (30.4%), electricity (11.1%),&nbsp;charcoal (6.4%), gas (LPG) (3.9%), and others (sawdust,&nbsp;agricultural waste, and others) (2.5%). Increase in the prices of the&nbsp;petroleum products within the past three decades is having adverse&nbsp;effects on the type of energy carriers used by households. About&nbsp;26.1% of women in urban area comment on the health implication&nbsp;of using the firewood as cooking energy whereas about 25.4% of&nbsp;women in the rural area indicated that the activities involved in the&nbsp;collection and usage of firewood is time consuming. Cooking&nbsp;which is done largely in built-in kitchens within the house has&nbsp;health implications for households due to high levels of pollution&nbsp;retained indoors. Transformation of firewood into less polluting<br />forms or through improved stoves and better ventilation will&nbsp;reduce harmful effects of domestic energy and create better&nbsp;environment for welfare of households.</p>",

These initiatives, among others, include process to establish a national REDD+ Trust Fund (NRTF) and the National Carbon Monitoring Centre (NCMC). In this paper, the on-going national REDD+ governance structure establishment processes at both local and national levels are analysed. &nbsp;The study focused on REDD+ governance process, the participating actors, power and power struggle and its effects on the political legitimacy underlying the REDD+ governance process. The study was undertaken through intensive review of literature and relevant reports and documents, and dialogue with actors involved in the process. It was found that while REDD+ governance continues to evolve, some non-economic actors are transforming themselves into economic actors and &lsquo;Power brokers&rsquo; in order to enhance their position in protecting their interests during the process. It was noted as well that strategic power and power struggles are emerging as part of the evolving processes at both local and national levels. The study concludes that strategic intervention/decision was required to facilitate smooth process and avoid the stalemate that can be caused by emerging power struggles in the national&nbsp;REDD+ governance structure development process. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "title": "Do protected areas really work to conserve species? A case study of three vulnerable woody species in the Sudanian zone of Burkina Faso",
        "description": "Natural vegetation and native plant species contribute significantly to the daily\r\nneeds of local people especially in developing countries. This exerts a high pressure on\r\nlocal species and jeopardizes the conservation of the most vulnerable plants. In Burkina\r\nFaso, conservation measures, such as the creation of protected forests, have been taken to\r\nsafeguard the remaining indigenous vegetation. However, little is known about the\r\neffectiveness of these protected areas in conserving biodiversity. This study assessed and\r\ncompared the population structures and regeneration potential of three vulnerable woody\r\nspecies\u00e2\u20ac\u201dDiospyros mespiliformis Hochst., Prosopis africana (Guill. & Perr.) Taub. and\r\nSterculia setigera Del.\u00e2\u20ac\u201din protected and unprotected areas in the Sudanian zone of\r\nBurkina Faso. The population structure and regeneration pattern of each species were\r\ncompared between the North and South Sudanian sectors of Burkina Faso. The populations\r\nof all three species were unstable in both protected and unprotected areas. D. mespiliformis\r\nand P. africana displayed relatively good regeneration while P. africana lacked regeneration\r\nin unprotected areas. Regeneration was poor for S. setigera, regardless of protection\r\nstatus. The results suggest that the populations of the targeted species are unstable,\r\nregardless of the protection status of the area considered. This is probably due to the high\r\nanthropogenic pressure facing natural resources and raises serious concerns about the\r\neffectiveness of the protected areas in conserving biodiversity. Urgent measures are needed",

        "description": "Local people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perceptions of plant species are an important source of information on species distribution and rarity, as well as long-term vegetation change. This study involves an ethnobotanical survey and the identification of potential factors that explain differences in the perceptions and valuation of woody plant species in three ethnic groups (Fulani, Mossi and Samo) of the sub-Sahel of Burkina Faso. Some 87 groups of informants from 20 villages were interviewed for this study. A species list of woody plants and their estimated abundance was categorized in terms of their uses: food, medicine, fodder, construction, energy and handicrafts. In addition, the most important species, and those considered a priority for conservation, were identified. A total of 90 woody species were mentioned in the six categories. They were from 64 genera and 32 families and sub-families, of which the Caesalpinioideae, Combretaceae, Mimosoideae and the Capparaceae dominated. In all three ethnic groups, more than 80 % of the reported species were used for energy, 60 % for medicine and 40\u00e2\u20ac\u201c50 % for food. Gender was not a determinant of plant use. However, age was found to have an impact on plant knowledge in all three ethnic groups, with older people (over 50 years) reporting significantly more species than younger people (25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c50 years): (U = 425, df: 15, 14, z = \u00e2\u02c6\u20194.42, p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in plant use among the three ethnic groups (ANOSIM; R = 0.64, p < 0.001), and this could be explained by differences in culture and local environmental conditions controlling species distribution and availability. Balanites aegyptiaca was the most used species by all three ethnic groups. The most important species and identified conservation priorities, from the informants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective, were similar for all ethnic groups and were mainly food species with a high socioeconomic value: Vitellaria paradoxa, Adansonia digitata, Tamarindus indica, Parkia biglobosa, Lannea microcarpa and Ziziphus mauritiana. Development projects should incorporate the preferences of local people for certain species as part of the overall strategy for poverty alleviation in Burkina Faso.",

        "title": "Effects of organic amendment on early growth performance of Jatropha curcas L. on a severely degraded site in the Sub-Sahel of Burkina Faso.",
        "description": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of organic amendment on the germination and growth patterns of Jatropha curcas L. on completely barren and degraded land in the Sahelian area of Burkina Faso. Prior to the field trials, laboratory germination tests were undertaken to explore the impact of different pre-treatments on germination of Jatropha seeds. Seeds soaked in water for 24 h had the highest mean rate of germination (86%) while\r\nseeds that were pre-treated with sulphuric acid did not germinate. The results of the field experiment showed that plant growth and biomass development were significantly enhanced by organic amendment compared to the control. With direct seeding, 20% of the plants treated with organic manure survived after years, while all seedlings of the control plot\r\nperished. In the plantations, 30% of the untreated seedlings remained alive whereas only 5% of the plants survived with amendment. The trials in unfenced plots were decimated by livestock grazing and trampling 2 months after the beginning of the experiment. This emphasizes the need to protect Jatropha plants at an early stage of their development\r\nfrom roaming animals. Organic amendment attracted humivorous termites, which were destructive to the seedlings. The use of pesticides may be necessary to control this problem. When directly seeded, plants of the control plots demonstrated poor growth and became rapidly diseased, further accelerating their decline. The low survival rates (5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30%) and meagre seedling performance, even for the amended plots, may be an indication that Jatropha is unsuited to severely degraded lands like the zippel\u00c3\u00a9, and cannot be expected to give good yields and the claimed environmental and socio-economic benefits. However,\r\nwe recommend that the performance of Jatropha on the zippel\u00c3\u00a9\u00c2\u00b4 should be further tested with other soil and water conservation techniques (half-moon, tillage, etc.) that have been shown to enhance crop production and yield on degraded lands in the Sahelo-Sudanian zone of West Africa. The impact of seed provenance on the outcome of this study is unknown.\r\nTherefore, further experiments should embrace seeds from different sources, including genotypes that are more adapted to dry conditions and might therefore show improved performance.",

        "description": "In developing countries many people depend on woody resources for their livelihoods. Monitoring human impact on the populations of socio-economically important species is therefore important for the conservation of vulnerable plants.\r\nIn order to assess and compare the population structure and regeneration patterns of three multipurpose species, namely Acacia seyal Del., Balanites aegyptiaca Delile and Pterocarpus lucens Lepr. in four ethnic areas of the sub-Sahel of Burkina Faso (Samo, Gourmantche\u00c2\u00b4, Fulani and Mossi), we used the size-class distribution method (SCD) (Condit et al., 1998). Diameter at breast height (Dbh) of adult individuals of each species were sampled on 1000m2 (20m\u000150 m) plots in each ethnic domain. Recorded Dbhs were distributed among eight size-classes of 5 cm intervals. For each species, the slope of the regression of the SCD was considered to be an indicator of the population structure.\r\nSeedlings and saplings were recorded on five nested 25m2 plots and fell into five height classes of 0\u00025m intervals.\r\nThe target species had significant ( p<0\u0002001) negative SCD slopes with an inverse J-shape distribution in all ethnic areas; indicating stable populations with good regeneration. Kruskal\u00e2\u20ac\u201cWallis test for the SCDs of A. seyal, B. aegyptiaca and P. lucens did not differ significantly among the ethnic areas (p>0\u00021). This suggests that the dynamics of each of the three species is similar across ethnic domains and the sub-Sahel. Data from P. lucens depicted an apparent stable population structure which contrasted with our field observations, perception of local people and previous studies.",

Cependant, cette am\u00c3\u00a9lioration des totaux pluviom\u00c3\u00a9triques annuels semble \u00c3\u00aatre partiellement le fait d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122une intensit\u00c3\u00a9 des pluies plus importante, alors que la longueur de la saison des pluies n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00c3\u00a9volue pas par rapport aux d\u00c3\u00a9cennies de s\u00c3\u00a9cheresse.

Les taux de croissance urbaine sont encore plus impressionnants et entra\u00c3\u00aenent chaque jour d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122importants bouleversements environnementaux.

En outre, le cheptel toujours plus nombreux et devant se satisfaire de parcours continuellement r\u00c3\u00a9duits engendre un surp\u00c3\u00a2turage. Le tout provoque donc une d\u00c3\u00a9gradation de la couverture v\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9tale du sol, une diminution globale des rendements des cultures, mais \u00c3\u00a9galement une forte r\u00c3\u00a9duction de la biodiversit\u00c3\u00a9.

In comparing the achievements with targets, strengths or weaknesses of established strategies can be accepted or corrections implemented since a plan also outlines some strategies for achieving the targets set. In this study, achievements in production&nbsp;and export of industrial forest products, i.e., sawn wood, plywood, chipboard and fibreboard, paper and paperboard and industrial&nbsp;<br />round wood, are compared against targeted figures for 1996 for Tanzania. Discrepancies were obtained by subtracting targeted from&nbsp;achieved values and expressed both as absolute and relative differences in terms of the targeted values, with a negative sign for production where achievements were less than targets and a positive sign when achievements were higher than targets. Values achieved&nbsp;ranged from 4%&ndash;100% of the targeted values, depending on the product, and were only higher than the targeted value for industrial&nbsp;<br />round wood. Possible causes of the discrepancies are inefficiency of parastatal companies, low private investment, sub-maximal in&nbsp;dustrial operation and plant inefficiencies. Discrepancies could also result from unrealistic data used in planning due to difficulty in&nbsp;data availability and poor intra- and inter-sectoral coordination. The implications of these discrepancies are low contributions of the&nbsp;wood-based industry to the national economy, increased import substitution of wood-based products, increased socio-economic and&nbsp;environmental degradation and decreased integrity in planning and policy making.&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>Resprouting can be an important means of<br />regeneration for forest tree species resulting in multi-<br />stemmed architecture, especially at less productive<br />or frequently disturbed sites. However, the cost of<br />resprouting may be traded off against growth or<br />reproduction. In subtropical coastal forest in South<br />Africa, trees grow on steep, sandy dunes with unstable<br />soils and low to moderate nutrient availability. These<br />coastal forests experience seasonally strong anticy-<br />clonic winds from August through October. We<br />examined the hypothesis that basal resprouting result-<br />ing in multiple stems causes lower rates of sexual<br />reproduction and recruitment by individuals. We<br />examined whether trees traded off resprouting against<br />seed output, seed size, seedling abundance and<br />recruitment by seedlings. Species were designated as&nbsp;</p><p>good and poor resprouters based on their frequency of<br />multi-stemmed individuals at Cape Vidal. Good resp-<br />routers had more stems, produced less seed and had<br />lower seed mass than poor resprouters, and had lower<br />seedling abundance and fewer individuals in small<br />diameter classes than large diameter classes. Seedling<br />abundance in good resprouters was not in\u00ef\u00ac\u201auenced by<br />the availability of understorey gaps. Good resprouters<br />were most abundant on dune crests and seaward slopes<br />that were exposed to sea winds. Persistence of estab-<br />lished individuals by producing multiple stems from<br />basal resprouts is important where a chronic distur-<br />bance regime potentially reduces the survivorship of<br />single-stemmed individuals and thereby their oppor-<br />tunities for reproduction. Good resprouters appear to<br />trade-off recruitment of new individuals for multiple<br />stems that increase the persistence of established ones<br />against disturbance. We conclude that multi-stemming<br />arising from basal resprouts has evolved to promote<br />individual persistence under low to moderate intensity<br />but pervasive wind stress.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Traditional medicine refers to health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses or maintain well-being. In the last decade traditional medicine has become very popular in Cameroon, partly due to the long unsustainable economic situation in the country. The high cost of drugs and increase in drug resistance&nbsp; to&nbsp; common&nbsp; diseases&nbsp; like&nbsp; malaria,&nbsp; bacteria&nbsp; infections&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; sexually&nbsp; transmitted&nbsp; diseases&nbsp; has&nbsp; caused&nbsp; the<br />therapeutic approach to alternative traditional medicine as an option for concerted search for new chemical entities (NCE).<br />The World Health Organisation (WHO) in collaboration with the Cameroon Government has put in place a strategic platform for the practice and development of TM in Cameroon. This platform aims at harmonizing the traditional medicine practice in the country, create a synergy between TM and modern medicine and to institutionalize a more harmonized integrated TM practices&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp; year&nbsp; 2012&nbsp; in&nbsp; Cameroon.&nbsp; An&nbsp; overview&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; practice&nbsp; of&nbsp; TM&nbsp; past,&nbsp; present&nbsp; and&nbsp; future&nbsp; perspectives&nbsp; that underpins the role in sustainable poverty alleviation has been discussed.

        "description": "<p>The development of local forest products is hampered by insufficient knowledge about their potential and inadequate assessments&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; impact&nbsp; on&nbsp; the national economy. Furthermore, lack of knowledge on the availability of agroforestry tree products (AFTPs) in their biotope prevents effective planning for sustainable management of non-timber forests products (NTFPs) to contribute to poverty reduction. A&nbsp; survey conducted in the&nbsp; Mbam-Inoubou&nbsp; region&nbsp; in&nbsp; central Cameroon shows the significant agroforestry&nbsp; potential&nbsp; of&nbsp; African&nbsp; walnut, Tetracarpidium conophorum, a vine considered&nbsp; as&nbsp; an&nbsp; important&nbsp; associated<br />species in cacao agroforests. The survey results indicate that this vine is fairly abundant in agroforests and commonly planted and used, and could therefore be included in the processing chain to improve household incomes at local, national and even regional levels. The surveys conducted for the study show that sales of products from this liana species can earn creditable incomes. Given this finding, an effort should be made by the different players concerned to improve the distribution of these products by supplying as much<br />information as possible. Doing so would ensure the promotion of African walnuts, oil extract and other new products by bringing them into the national and international marketing system.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The tribe Psoraleeae (Leguminosae subfamily Papilionoideae) comprises 185 species in nine genera that have a nearly worldwide distribution, occurring predominantly in Mediterranean regions. About 60% of the species belong to the genera, Otholobium C.H.Stirt. and Psoralea L., which have a centre of diversity in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Since previous molecular studies have sampled only a few species of the tribe from this region, this study sought to determine the phylogenetic position of the southern African<br />genera and to test whether they are monophyletic. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using<br />DNA sequence data (trnL-F, rpoB-trnC and ITS) and seven morphological characters, which diagnose the<br />two southern African genera. The data were analysed using the parsimony method. There was strong support for the Psoraleeae as a clade, but most of the nodes within the large genera were poorly supported. The southern African species of Psoralea and Otholobium together formed a strongly supported clade. This clade was sister to the genus Hoita Rydb., but without support. However, the Psoralea species were nested within the southern African Otholobium. Additionally, some South American species that are currently recognised as Otholobium were resolved in a clade distinct fromthe southern African species, making Otholobiumpolyphyletic. Morphological characters that separate Otholobium and Psoralea are discussed. Finally, the southern African genera as currently circumscribed are not monophyletic. However, further investigations using more informative DNA loci are required to validate this observation. Furthermore, the taxonomic placement of the South American species needs to be reviewed.</p>",

This phenomenon is frequently encountered in Cyperaceae, where characters traditionally used to diagnose genera have been shown to have\r\nevolved independently multiple times. Th e Ethiopian high-altitude perennial fi rst described as Cyperus clandestinus was subsequently moved to Ficinia because it has spiral glume arrangement, unlike typical Cyperus species, which have distichous glume arrangement. However, this position has remained uncertain as no nutlets have previously been studied\r\nto establish the presence or absence of the gynophore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the synapomorphy for Ficinia. We resolve this 140-year-old puzzle by describing the morphology of the nutlet, which lacks a gynophore, and use DNA sequence data to resolve the taxon within Cyperus. Cyperus clandestinus was found to be closely related to Remirea maritima and Cyperus cyperoides in\r\nthe C 4 Cyperus clade, whose members predominantly have distichously arranged glumes. Th is provides further evidence for the unreliability of glume arrangement as a character to distinguish between members of the Cyperus and Ficinia clades, whereas gynophore presence is more congruent with molecular data.",

Species delimitation and identification in the genus are difficult. Many putative species are unpublished or known only by manuscript names. As a first step to address this problem this study reports on the taxonomy of the Psoralea aphylla complex \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a distinct group of species characterised by either a complete absence of leaves, a reduction of the leaves into scales, or the occurrence of small filiformleaflets. Plants may be suffrutices, small to large shrubs, or trees.Morphological and ecological analyses of herbariumspecimens and recent field collections distinguished ten species within the complex. Three species (P. aphylla L., P. filifolia Eckl. & Zeyh. and P. peratica C.H.Stirt.) are already published, while the seven other taxa have been known by manuscript names and are formalised in this paper (P. congesta C.H.Stirt. & Muasya; P. fleta C.H.Stirt.; P. gigantea Dludlu,Muasya & C.H.Stirt.; P. pullata C.H.Stirt.; P. ramulosa C.H.Stirt.; P. rigidula C.H.Stirt.; and P. usitata C.H.Stirt.).\r\nWe provide a key for the identification of all ten species along with full descriptions, illustrations, distribution maps and some notes on the conservation statuses of the species.",

        "description": "<p>At least 200 000 m3 of timber is harvested annually using semi-mechanised harvesting systems on the Viphya forest plantations in Malawi. Although these systems have long been used on the Viphya, no investigation on their productivity has so far been reported. Additionally, the absence of localised productivity analyses in Malawi has created a paucity of information on appropriate timber harvesting systems for production maximisation and cost minimisation. The objective of this study was to compare the production rates and operational costs of chainsaw/grapple skidder (semi-mechanised) and feller-buncher/grapple skidder (mechanised) harvesting systems in order to determine the economic feasibility of mechanised systems in the Viphya forest plantations. The study was conducted in Pinus kesiya compartments at the Kalungulu and Champhoyo forest stations of the Viphya forest plantations. A work study approach was followed to capture harvesting time and volume data for the semi-mechanised system. Secondary work study data were used to simulate productivity of the mechanised system on similar compartment conditions. A timber- harvesting costing model was used to analyse the results. The study showed that the simulated mechanised system was associated with lower operating costs and inventories with higher production rates than the semi-mechanised system. The cost marginal difference was US$0.89 m&minus;3. It was therefore established that migration to mechanised systems could optimise timber harvesting productivity on the Viphya in future, if optimal volumes are available to ensure the efficient application of the mechanised harvesting system.</p>",

        "description": "Climate Change is rapidly unfolding challenge of catastrophic at global, regional and national level. India is among the countries which will be hit hardest by the effects of climate change. The effect of these changes are exerting on all human struggle for survivable activity. Under the threat of global warming, it is vital to determine the impacts that future changes in climate may have on the environment and to what extent any adverse effects can be mitigated. In this research work the climate trends have been triggered recently and examined the difference between the trends of climate change for the period 1901 to 2007. Long term data was assessed for various aspects of East Coast of Andhra Pradesh climate using suitable statistical techniques of Mann Kendal trend test. Results indicate that variability for extreme temperature is increasing throughout the whole season. The change is significantly high for winter season than others. This is continuing further exacerbated by increased and more variable extreme temperatures. The clear demarcation in two groups of data (1901-1950 and 1951-2007 for temperature) is good indicator for understanding past and present situation. This means that when we compared the two types of data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interpretation of tests it, would lead us to draw much quit different conclusion for the same area. Therefore, it could be concluded that a significant changes of the temperature over the study area and has been increasingly affected by a significant change in climatic extremes during the second half of the 20th century. This might be the case of high level of emission of green house gases mainly carbondioxede. Global, regional, national, and local level mitigation options have to be implemented to minimize green house gases by using binding laws.",

        "title": "Climate ChangeImpact Interventions on Cropping Practices ofBati District, Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia.",
        "description": "The livelihoods of Ethiopian society are heavily depends on the agricultural sector. Agriculture in Ethiopia in general and in the Bati District in particular is subsistence, traditional and nature dependent.  Thus, it is highly susceptible to risk and uncertainty resulting from climate change. To prevent and reduce the vulnerability of the community due to climate change impacts and to increase the community\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adaptive capacity, the Bati Adapts to Climate Change Impacts (BACCI) Project was initiated by CHF (Canadian Hungry foundation) and ORDA (Organization for Rehabilitation Development in Amhara). Independent evaluators were assigned to quantify the changes brought by the project interventions. The study team assessed the validation, effectiveness, and achievement evaluations by qualitative and quantitative methods. The results revealed that the adoption levels of those interventions were different by different households. The farmers in the project area cultivated more than one crops for household consumption and for commercial use. It also indicated that the farmers in this area attempted to use relatively more improved seeds and improved farming practices for most of the crops cultivated. A significant proportion of smallholder farmers have used manuring (96.8%), intercropping (94.9%), composting (80.8%), biological control (76.9%), row planting (75.6%) and crop rotation (75%) by the project. This suggests that the smallholder farmers in the project areas attempted to practice environmentally friendly and economically affordable organic and diverse climate change impacts resilient farming techniques. Moreover, beneficiary households have good awareness regarding climate responsive dry-season gardening practice by the intensive provision of training for different groups. Creation of market outlet and increase market access and complementarities with other districts plans and other climate change impact adaptation initiatives were recommended.",

        "title": "A review of Wetland Conservation and Management Policy in Ethiopian",
        "description": "In Ethiopia, wetlands cover nearly 2% of the total land area of the country. They are one of the most productive ecosystems and perform many functions that maintain ecological integrity. They provide lots of goods and services that encompass agricultural production, tourism, and biodiversity conservation, social, economic as well as cultural activities. More specifically, wetlands are crucial resources of income generation and livelihood for local communities.  Despite the diverse benefits that wetlands provide, lack of effective management has led to their continued degradation that includes unsustainable activities such as converting wetlands into agricultural and grazing lands, using them as waste disposal sites, and overexploitation of resources. Misconception about wetlands and  considering them as wastelands and breeding grounds of mosquitoes and also absence of clearly defined tenure right on wetlands are further challenges that exacerbate wetlands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 degradation. In response to the aforementioned challenges and threats, there have been commendable efforts exerted by scholars in the last decades to publicize the value of wetlands to the national and local economy in a number of national and regional awareness-creation workshops. In many of these workshops, apart from emphasizing the significance of wetlands and expressing the looming threats imposed on them, the need for formulating a national policy or a wetland development strategy that could enhance sustenance of their ecological and socioeconomic functions for the present and future generations of the country was boldly stated.  Ethiopia stands for environmentally safe world and has given due consideration to natural resource protection and management in which wetlands are a component.  Although the country hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adopted clearly defined national policy on wetland conservation and management, the issue of wetlands has been indirectly mentioned in various policies and legal frameworks including the National Water Resources Management Policy, the Federal Environmental Policy, the Biodiversity Policy, Agricultural and Natural Resources Development Policy and the Land Administration and Use Policy, National Conservation Strategy of Ethiopia. Though these policy frameworks are potentially helpful to introduce better management of wetlands in the country, the reality on the ground shows that wetlands are being mismanaged and some of them are in a state of extinction. To assure a sustainable wetland ecosystem development and addresses the multiple interests of stakeholders, it seems rational either to strengthen and act in accordance with the existing policy frameworks or to initiate a National Wetland Conservation and Development Policy. Adopting international conventions, such as the Ramsar Convention, that facilitate wetland conservation and sustainable utilization is also very important. To influence policy makers appreciate the value of enacting a strong policy framework for wetland conservation and management professionals would be required to further strengthen their  efforts to produce more tangible data on current status of wetlands and also clearly demonstrate how wetlands support the livelihood of the local people and the ecosystem in general. Considering the cross-sectoral nature of wetland management, it is of crucial importance to designate a responsible agency to guide and coordinate the development interventions in wetland resources.",

        "description": "Statistical downscaling models for temperature and precipitation in South Wollo Zone, which is located between 10\u00c2\u00b0 05\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2N, and 14\u00c2\u00b005\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2N latitude and 38\u00c2\u00b000\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 and 40\u00c2\u00b025\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2E longitude, Ethiopia, have been developed and applied to calculate the changes in historic, current and the future climate changes. Projected changes in precipitation and temperature were analyzed using outputs from GCMs and daily station data (1980-2012) which were collected from 6 observed meteorological stations (predictand) using SDSM version 4.2.9. A historical-modification procedure was used to downscale large scale outputs from GCM models to station climate data. The study then investigated how these changes in temperature and precipitation might translate into changes in livelihoods of people and other biophysical components using impact assessment. The objective of this paper was to see the effect of grid size on model accuracy, to evaluate the statistical downscaling methods in estimating monthly average rainfall and temperature, and to project the future climate situation. Accordingly, the results revealed that both temperatures showed an increasing trend; the increase in mean maximum temperature and mean minimum temperature change were 6.17\u00cb\u0161C and 5.65\u00cb\u0161C respectively by 2080s from the base period 1980-2012. While, a decreased in percentage change of about 14.2 to 43.3% from the mean annual precipitation was recorded by the year 2080s. Therefore, it can facilitate the decision makers to incorporate climate change scenarios for devising sustainable strategies, including: Water harvesting technologies, supplementary irrigation, using improved seeds, which can tolerate moisture stresses, aforestations and reforestation programs, and soil and water conservation techniques. Moreover, crop diversifications, agricultural extension services access, related strategies, and measures are highly recommended for climate change resiliencies strategies.",

        "title": "TREND ANALYSIS AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN NORTH CENTRAL ETHIOPIA",
        "description": "Climate change is one of the most important global environmental challenges, with implications for food production, water supply, health, energy, etc. Addressing climate change requires a good scientific understanding as well as coordinated action both at national and global level. Climate change is a key emerging threat to the lives and livelihoods of the rural poor in Ethiopia. Adaptation to climate change is a two-step process, which initially requires the perception that climate is changing and then responding to changes through adaptation. This study was conducted in selected rural kebeles\r\nof Bahir Dar Zuria district. The study employed both qualitative and quantitative methodologies and triangulation of data. It tried to show the significance of climate change by using forty-nine years of temperature and rainfall data, which were processed using XLSTAT software, in addition to the socio-economic data collected to assess the perception of farmers. Analysis of the historical climate data and its models in North Central Ethiopia revealed that there has been an increasing trend of maximum and minimum temperature and a general tendency of decreasing rainfall. The mean average change of\r\nannual temperature indicates significant variations of temperature observations approximately by 1.5oc. On the other hand, the average amount of annual rainfall change indicated by Mann-Kendall trend test and Homogeneity test results of p-value\r\nless than alpha=0.05, were significant. The households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interview data analysis also shows that regarding the direction of the change in temperature and rainfall, 78% of the sample households perceived an increase in annual temperature and 66.7% a decreased in annual rainfall. The adaptation methods used include - use of moisture stress resistant crops,\r\nchanging the management and planting date, irrigation, crop diversification: mixed crop-livestock farming systems, and increased use of water and soil conservation techniques. Therefore, it is concluded that most of the farmers perceived the climate change by their field experience and started adaptation strategies. In this regard, much remains to be done by governmental and none governmental actors to harness the value of indigenous knowledge, to empower and genuinely allow full participation of farmers and to implement environmental sustainability, technological adaptability, adaptation programs and plans.",

        "title": "APPLICATION OF GIS ON ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION DUE TO THE OFFSHOOTS OF HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS: CENTRAL ETHIOPIAN HIGHLANDS",
        "description": "Physical land degradation after road building has been observed in Central Ethiopian highlands through gully erosion. In this research work by using a number of methods such as Field observation, gully measurement, GIS technique, the 1997 and 2006 topomap and socio-economic questionnaires, the impacts of the road on land degradation has been studied. It investigates how highway construction in the Ethiopian Highlands affects the gully erosion risk by quantifying the catchment area before and after road construction, the number of gullies created, and its characteristics in two selected cases: Addis Ababa-Fiche and Addis Ababa-Ambo. Accordingly; since the building of the road, 17 new gullies were\r\ncreated immediately down slope of the studied road segments and 8 other gullies at a radical change in its dimensions. The average catchment area is now 58.28 hectares and 74.52 on the road segments of Fiche and Ambo respectively, which is significantly different (p<0.001) from the average pre-road catchment area of 8.45 and 14.52 hectares (paired average). The total surface area occupied by gullies in the side of Fiche road and in the side of Ambo road transects was about 63,892.6 m2 and 59,214.25 m2 respectively. The volume of soil loss was calculated between 12,530.38 m3 and 71,420 m3 from each\r\nroad segments. The result of statistical analysis indicates that variation of the gully length contributed 95% of variation in the volume of soil loss. The Gully density (5.7m/ha to 14.06m/ha) implies that the sampled roadside areas were moderately to severely degraded. The damages and associated problems of the gullies, as explained by farmers, include loss of land, dissection of farms, and deposition of sediments on growing crops and in extreme cases putting agricultural fields out of production. Hence roads should be designed in a way that keeps runoff interception, concentration and deviation minimal. Techniques must be used to spread concentrated runoff in space and time and to increase its infiltration instead of directing it straight onto unprotected slope",

        "title": "Evaluation of Watershed Development Plan and Technology Adoption Level of Farmers in Amhara Region, The case of SWHISA Project, Ethiopia",
        "description": "Watershed development projects in Ethiopia were very few in number. The institutional strengthening project was implemented by Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and was principally aimed at capacity building of agricultural technicians, experts, and development agents in the highland regions of the country. The projects used the sub-watershed as the planning unit and sought the views of local technicians and members of the farming community to prepare land use and capability plans for soil and water conservation. SWHISA Project has been implementing several interventions in the Amhara Regional State. Among others, the watershed development projects conducted in six watersheds located in South Gondar, East Gojjam, South Wollo, North Wollo and North Shewa Zones aimed at improving the biophysical and socio-economic conditions of the area. This study aimed to evaluate the watershed plans of the project and the technology adoption level of farmers. In addition to the biophysical parameters, a total sample of 40 households from each watershed was selected randomly. Generally, a total of 240 (40x6) sample households were considered. The data management and analysis was done using SPSS and Microsoft excel sheet. Accordingly, Sustainable Water Harvesting and Institutional Strengthening in Amhara(SWHISA) project tried to intervene implemented and resulted in significant changes in many of the farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 problems. Among those plans, which resulted in significant changes, soil and water conservation works are the most effective watershed plan in all the study sites. On the other hand, most of the technologies introduced were highly and moderately adopted by farmers. Regarding sustainability, about 80 % of the sample respondents have explained their willingness to continue practicing SWHISA project interventions even in the absence of the project. From this study, it is possible to conclude that SWHISA project\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan was more or less implemented and adopted. However; the study team also recommends the Identification of potential farming households for capital-intensive technologies, strengthen monitoring and evaluation system, avoid partiality in capacity building management, and reduce dependency syndrome and Stepwise introduction of technologies.",

        "description": "The contribution of a 25 year old cashew (Anacardium occidentale)plantation to site quality development was determined by trial studies in Isuochi, Abia State of Nigeria. This was based on floristic, soil and litter assessment studies. Transects were cut and quadrats randomly thrown and floristic recruitments that have established within the plantation were identified. Soil analysis involved augal soil sample collection from 2 soil depths (0-15cm, 15-30cm) and analyzed in a laboratory for N, P, K, OM and pH. Litter fall assessments also employed random positioning of quadrat at different points and leaf litters collected at the floor of the plantation and analyzed in a laboratory for N, OM and lignin contents. A 5 -year old fallow land (control) located within the area of study was investigated and similar procedures for floristic, soil and litter fall assessments were carried out as above. Results of floristic assessments were analysed using descriptive statistics. Species\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Richness Index (SRI)and Fuzzy model Community Index (CI) for site quality determination were also used. Results of soil analysis were fitted into approved Soil Quality Index (SQI) formular and calculated. Floristic abundance was low in the cashew plantation (50 plants/0.3ha.) with SRI and CI of 0.4 and 0.5 respectively while it was 683.75/0.3ha. with SRI and CI of 0.46 and 1 respectively. Soil nutrients were higher at both soil depths in the control while cashew plantation showed high lignin content in the litter (18.17%). SQI was -8.12% and -5.72% in the plantation at 0-15 and 15-30cm depths respectively but was 14% and 46.78% in the control in the respective depths. Age, character of species/parts, mineralization rate, floristic diversity and soil nutrient base are contributory to soil quality of a given site. \r\nKey words: \r\n",

        "title": "Rehabilitation of degraded landscapes through area exclosure in the Central Rift Valley",
        "description": "Woody species population structure and dynamics, soil seed bank and herbaceous and grass biomass were studied in exclosure area of Gara Adulala from 2003 to 2007 to evaluate the status of the rehabilitation of the site. A total of 20 indigenous woody species, dominated by tree species Acacia gerrardii, Acacia tortilis, Dichrostachys cinerea and Acacia senegal, were recorded in the area. The number and type of species over the five years remained the same whereas the number of stems per hectare showed a steady increment till the fourth year. The overall pattern of population dynamics showed a marked increment in number of stems in year V than year I, but with no clear pattern in the middle years. Acacia gerrardii, Dichrostachys cinerea and Acacia senegal showed similar pattern with the overall structure, however, Acacia tortilis showed decrease in number in the last year. The overall number of seedlings and saplings per hectare of the woody species varied from 496 to 1070 and from 513 to 1217, respectively over the five years. The sources of regeneration for many of the species were sprouts, and there was strong recruitment of seedlings to saplings. The soil seed bank in the first year was represented by only herbaceous and grass species. A significant increment in herbaceous and grass biomass was obtained in the last two years when compared to the first year. We conclude that population structure varies over the years due to climate, competition among sprouts and individuals for moisture and nutrients, and hence exclosure areas need to be managed for optimum stocking and be assisted with planting.\r\nKey words: area exclosure, biomass, population structure, regeneration, seed bank\r\n",

        "description": "<p>One of the most important plant growth limiting factors in dry land areas is moisture. Water harvesting supports a sustainable agricultural production in dry land areas, where rainfall is low and erratic in distribution. Thus, identification and application of improved rainwater harvesting structures for tree establishment can help tree plantation and production in dry areas. The experiment was conducted at Gara Adulala near MARC. The area is characterized as semi-arid area and it is part of the central rift valley of Ethiopia, where climatic variability prevails. The study focused on the identification of economical and appropriate micro-catchment water harvesting systems for the support of early survival of tree seedlings in dry areas. Plots containing four treatments (types of micro-catchments) namely: Semi-circular bund, Eyebrow terraces, Contour-bench terraces and infiltration pits (control) were randomly distributed in three blocks. The results showed highly significant differences between structures in supporting the early survival of tree seedlings at 95% confidence limits. The highest survival percentages of tree seedlings were recorded in Semi-circular bunds (81.7%) and followed by Contour-bench terraces (76.7%) and least performance was recorded in infiltration pits (5.0%). The use of these structures can reduce the risk of losing seedlings during long drought seasons in moisture stress areas. Therefore, the application of semicircular bunds and contour-bench terraces can help increase the survival rates of seedlings in early growth period and enhance the establishment of trees in dry land areas.

        "description": "Browse shrubs and trees, in spite of their signi\u00ef\u00ac\u0081cant role in livestock production in arid and semi-arid zones, are often omitted from pasture potential assessments because of the lack of methodology, the dif\u00ef\u00ac\u0081culty in calculation or method application and because it is usually a long and tedious task. For an accurate estimation of the carrying capacity of rangelands the shrub and tree fodder component has to be taken into account in order to avoid under estimation of the potential phytomass available for browsing. In this study, a semi-destructive method was used to develop fodder prediction equations of seven shrub and tree species based on multiple explanatoryvariables at four different locations in Burkina Faso (Taffogo, Safan\u00c3\u00a9, Nob\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9, Dano and Sokouraba). The physical characteristics (explanatory variables) and the leaf weight (response variable) of the plants were measured or calculated and the non collinear explanatory variables correlated with the response variable. More than 50 % of the observed variation in fodder was explained by the basal area and/or the crown cover for all the target species except Ficus sur at Sokouraba and both Acacia seyal and Balanites aegyptiaca at Safane. The prediction equations were species-speci\u00ef\u00ac\u0081c and equations developed for the same species in different sites were different. These results suggest that many local species-speci\u00ef\u00ac\u0081c fodder prediction equations have to be developed to get an accurate fodder prediction in a large scale, and practitioners of rangelands management may be cautious about applying general species-speci\u00ef\u00ac\u0081c prediction equation tables.\r\nKeywords: Browse species, Pasture assessment, Fodder equations ,Basal area , Crown area.\r\n",

However, many CBFGs have not met expectations due to internal weaknesses and external obstacles. This study describes the current status of CBFGs in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia; identifies drivers and barriers for developing CBFGs; and generates insights about how barriers are best addressed. The report combines case studies of 11 CBFGs and a verification workshop. Several factors suggest that the development of CBFGs in the region has been positive, including a high membership; strong commitment; basic operational skills; the growth of local, regional and international markets; and infrastructure improvements. Impediments to CBFG success include inappropriate registration of the organisations, insecure access rights, weak leadership and organisational capacities, limited resources, weak market access and limited entrepreneurial and value adding capacity. This study concludes by suggesting measures to improve the future development of CBFGs in the region.",

        "description": "Agroforestry practices can improve the adaptive capacity and resilience of local farming and subsistence systems while providing livelihood benefits to households. However, scaling up of agroforestry technology has often proved difficult. Many studies have been carried out to explain the lack of tangible impact, based mainly on formal household/farm surveys comparing characteristics of non-adopters with that of adopters. In this study, we mapped the relationship between agroforestry tree survival in villages that were a part of the Vi Agroforestry project in the Mara region, Tanzania with key social-ecological variables. A random sample of 21 households from each of 89 investigated project villages was used. The proportion of households with surviving agroforestry trees, varied from 10%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c90% among villages. Social and ecological differences between villages were important explanations to this variation. Variables related to the project and its operations explained most of the inter-village variation in households with few surviving trees. To encourage the majority of village households to practice agroforestry their perceptions of tree ownership and the benefit of agroforestry were additional key factors to the project showing the importance of socio-cultural issues to the households\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decisions to continue beyond the initial tree planting and testing phase.\r\n",

        "description": "The situation for governors and managers of natural resources has increased in complexity. Previously it was enough to sustain the yields of wood, food and energy. Today, maintenance of ecosystem services, conservation of biodiversity, rural development and human wellbeing are new additional objectives. At the same time there are new risks and uncertainties linked to climate change, economic globalisation, energy security and water supply. Consequently, adaptive and holistic research, governance and management are needed. Landscape is a concept and framework that can be used as an approach to enhance implementation of policies about sustainable development as a societal process and sustainability as outcomes on the ground. Using a hierarchical framework consisting of principles, concepts and initiatives, we chose three widely agreed principles for SD and sustainability and five international concepts for implementation for our analysis to define landscape approach. We propose a practical operationalization that consists of five core attributes, (1) a sufficiently large area that matches management requirements and challenges to deliver desired goods, services and values, (2) multi-level and multi-sector stakeholder collaboration that promotes sustainable development as a social process, (3) commitment to and understanding of sustainability as an aim among stakeholders, (4) integrative knowledge production, and (5) sharing of experience, results and information, to develop local and experiential knowledge to explicit. Finally, we discuss the need for integrative research to study landscape approach concepts and what local initiatives using different concepts deliver on the ground.",

        "title": " Tending for cattle: Traditional fire management in Ethiopian montane heathlands",
        "description": "Fire has long been a principal tool for manipulating ecosystems, notably for pastoralist cultures, but in modern times, fire use has often been a source of conflicts with state bureaucracies. Despite this, traditional fire management practices have rarely been examined from a perspective of fire behavior and fire effects, which hampers dialogue on management options. In order to analyze the rationale for fire use, its practical handling, and ecological effects in high-elevation ericaceous heathlands in Ethiopia, we used three different information sources: interviews with pastoralists, field observations of fires, and analysis of vegetation age structure at the landscape level. The interviews revealed three primary reasons for burning: increasing the grazing value, controlling a toxic caterpillar, and reducing predator attacks. Informants were well aware of critical factors governing fire behavior, such as slope, wind, vertical and horizontal fuel structure, and fuel moisture. Recent burns (1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 years since fire) were used as firebreaks to control the size of individual burns, which resulted in a mosaic of vegetation of different ages. The age structure indicated an average fire return interval of ~10 years. At these elevations (> 3500 m), the dry period is unreliable, with occasional rains. Of all observed fires, 83% were ignited during very high Fire Weather Index levels, reached during only 11% of all days of the year. Burning is illegal, but if this ban was respected, our data suggest that the Erica shrubs would grow out of reach of cattle within a few years only, creating a dense and continuous canopy. This would also create a risk of large high-intensity wildfires since the landscape is virtually devoid of natural fuel breaks. Under the present management regime, this heathland ecosystem should be quite resilient to degradation by fire due to a relatively slow fuel buildup (limiting fire intervals) and an effective regrowth of Erica shoots. Nevertheless, if burning is done during severe drought, there may be a risk of smoldering fires killing the lignotubers. Given the intimate knowledge of fire behavior and fire effects among these pastoralists, it should be possible to develop a fire management plan that can sustain the present land use and ecosystem, and be sanctioned by both authorities and the local community.",

At the same time, the fuel bed is not spatially uniform, but a complex\r\nmix of shrubs and herbaceous vegetation that will change with time since fire. These patterns\r\nare further influenced by megaherbivores capable of consuming large quantities of biomass\r\nthat otherwise would enter the fuel bed, but the net effects for temporal thresholds of flammability\r\nare poorly known.\r\n2. We quantified post-fire fuel succession and effects of free-ranging cattle in high-elevation\r\nErica shrublands in Ethiopia where traditional fire management is still practised above the\r\ntreeline at 3500 m, despite being challenged by authorities.\r\n3. We found a near-linear accumulation of canopy fuel at 2\u00016 Mg ha\r\n\u00031 year\r\n\u00031, but stands\r\n<5 years old did not burn due to spatial separation of individual Erica shrubs before canopy\r\nclosure and lack of fine dead fuels.\r\n4. Inside cattle exclosures, Erica height growth was nearly three times faster and reached the\r\nassumed flammability threshold c. 3 years earlier than in browsed/grazed stands, where cattle\r\nalso kept herbaceous vegetation between shrubs short, thus eliminating litter that could otherwise\r\nbridge the discontinuous fuel bed in early succession.\r\n5. Modelling of fire behaviour indicated progressively higher fire intensity and rate of spread\r\nfor stands >5 years. But if stands escape fire for several decades, flammability again\r\ndecreases as canopy fuels become increasingly separated from the ground. This may be the\r\nultimate reason for sharp treelines on many tropical mountains where fire is confined mainly\r\nto higher elevations.\r\n6. Synthesis and applications. In shrublands where dominant plants can outgrow consumption\r\nby large herbivores, provision of good cattle habitat typically requires fire. We found\r\nthat fire and cattle interact to maintain a relatively stable system, where fuel limitation in\r\nearly succession creates fire breaks that prevent landscape-wide wildfires. The same negative\r\nfeedback protects the Erica from degradation by too frequent fires. As shrublands can have\r\nwidely different compositions, the response to variation in fire frequency and herbivore pressure is likely to differ, but for sustainable management fire and grazing have to be treated in consort.",

        "description": "Pastoralists frequently depend on fire to produce forage for their livestock, but traditional burning is often banned, despite being essential for livelihoods and ecosystem maintenance. In the subalpine heathlands of Bale Mountains traditional fire management is still practiced. This offered a rare opportunity to analyze fire ecology and traditional fire knowledge in a fire-managed shrub system. My aim was to disentangle the interactions between livestock, fuels and vegetation in the heathlands and the forests below, through a combination of experimental and observational studies. My results show that the subalpine forests had a low fire potential due to lack of good surface fuels. In contrast, the Erica-dominated heathlands produced highly flammable fuel complexes. Here anthropogenic burning resulted in a regime of high-intensity fires with an average fire return interval of ~10 years. However, the grazed heathlands were non-flammable the first ~4 years post fire, due to lack of fine dead fuels and a discontinuous fuel bed. This helps create a patchy landscape in which young vegetation patches act as fire breaks, limiting the extent of subsequent fires. Interviews with pastoralists revealed three objectives for burning: to improve pasture, to remove an insect pest and to reduce livestock loss to predators. The informants were well aware of the critical relations between fuel structure, weather and fire behaviour, showing intimate knowledge of fire as a management tool. Cattle exclusion had relatively little impact on the vegetation and fuel development in both heathland and forest. Cattle browsing, however, dramatically altered the competitive balance between the two co-dominant shrubs E. arborea and E. trimera, favouring E. arborea. In the heathland the return to a flammable state was somewhat faster when cattle were excluded, but in the forest a denser field layer developed which did not increase flammability. Vegetative regeneration dominated after both fire and mechanical disturbance, despite a large seed bank in the top 10 cm of soil in both heathland and forest sites. In heathland sown Hagenia tree seedlings grew extremely poorly, probably due to unsuitable soil conditions. Neither did Hagenia seedlings survive in the forest zone, except in exclosures in large canopy gaps, showing that cattle exclusion alone is not sufficient for tree regeneration. Thus, the present division between heathland and forest is stabilized by the lack of fire potential in the forest and lack of potential for tree expansion into heathland. My results suggest that fire exclusion is not a viable option for the heathlands. It would destroy the pasture quality and is also unlikely to succeed, since huge tracts of highly flammable vegetation would soon develop. To successfully protect these ecosystems and pastoralist livelihoods, I recommend that a joint management plan is created that allows burning, but with defined prescriptions with regard to both fire intervals and fire weather.",

        "description": "Mammalian herbivores have the potential to alter the competitive relations of woody species, if consumption is unevenly distributed between species. At elevations above 3,500 m in the southern Ethiopian highlands, vegetation is dominated by Erica arborea and E. trimera. Both species can potentially grow into short trees, but are burnt on a rotation of 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 years, and regenerate by re-sprouting from belowground lignotubers. The regenerating scrub is heavily browsed by cattle. We set up browsing exclosures at three burnt sites to quantify the impact of browsing over a 3-year period. When protected from browsing, E. trimera had similar or better height growth than E. arborea, but in browsed vegetation, E. arborea instead grew taller. Browsing was more intense on E. trimera in the first years after fire, indicating a difference in palatability between the species. We checked if browse quality differed, by analysing shoot contents of acid detergent fibre (ADF), protein, phenolics and tannins. Contrary to expectations, the preferred E. trimera contained more ADF, less protein and had a higher tannin activity than E. arborea. Although the vegetative growth of E. arborea is favoured relative to E. trimera under high browsing pressure, rapid change in abundance would not be expected, since short-interval fire will repeatedly eradicate any gains in vegetative growth. However, within the typical fire return interval of less than 10 years, E. trimera barely reach a reproductive state, whereas E. arborea flower profusely. Under the current regime of fire and browsing, this may in the long run be more important than differences in height growth, leading to a gradual increase in the proportion of E. arborea.",

        "description": "Marine ecosystems are experiencing unprecedented degradation rates higher than any other ecosystem on the planet, which in some instances are up to 4 times those of rainforests. Mangrove ecosystems have especially been impacted by compounded anthropogenic pressures leading to significant cover reductions of between 35 and 50% (equivalent to 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2% loss pa) for the last half century. The main objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that peri-urban mangroves suffering from compounded and intense pressures may be experiencing higher degradation rates than the global mean (and/or national mean for Kenya) using Mombasa mangroves (comprising Tudor and Mwache creeks) as a case study. Stratified sampling was used to sample along 22 and 10 belt transects in Mwache and Tudor respectively, set to capture stand heterogeneity in terms of species composition and structure in addition to perceived human pressure gradients using proximity to human habitations as a\r\nproxy. We acquired SPOT (HRV/ HRVIR/ HRS) images of April 1994, May 2000 and January 2009 and a vector mangrove map of 1992 at a scale of 1 : 50000 for cover change and species composition analysis. Results from image classification of the 2009 image had 80.23% overall accuracy and Cohen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kappa of 0.77, thus proving satisfactory for use\r\nin this context. Structural data indicate that complexity index (CI) which captures stand structural development was higher in Mwache at 1.80 compared to Tudor at 1.71. From\r\ncover change data, Tudor lost 86.9% of the forest between 1992 and 2009, compared to Mwache at 45.4 %, representing very high hitherto undocumented degradation rates of\r\n5.1 and 2.7%pa respectively. These unprecedentedly high degradation rates, which far exceed not only the national mean (for Kenya of 0.7%pa) but the global mean as well,\r\nstrongly suggest that these mangroves are highly threatened due to compounded pressures. Strengthening of governance regimes through enforcement and compliance to halt illegal\r\nwood extraction, improvement of land-use practices upstream to reduce soil erosion, restoration in areas where natural regeneration has been impaired, provision of alternative\r\nenergy sources/building materials and a complete moratorium on wood extraction especially in Tudor Creek to allow recovery are some of the suggested management interventions.",

        "description": "Farmers living in most Arid and Semi-Arid Tropics (ASATs) of Kenya face the great challenge of fetching water from alternative sources to curb the effect of drought on rainfed agriculture and forestry. They recourse to traditional Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) measures and other available technologies for saving blue water. Yet, these technologies have become ineffective, owing to the intensity of water disasters arising from climate change and the unsound management of the catchment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s land and water resources. Hence, Green Water Credits (GWC) schemes have been propounded to be bio-physically needed, technologically possible, politically and socially acceptable, and economically feasible for ensuring adaptation to and mitigation of climate related water disasters. These schemes significantly rely on effective SWC measures, hydro-policies, agro-technologies and Payments for Environmental Services (PES) to mitigate the effects of drought on farming and forestry. This paper reveals the strengths and challenges facing these schemes in the ASATs of Kenya. Policy makers need to address these issues prior to implementing GWC schemes.",

        "description": "Osyris lanceolata (East African Sandalwood) is an evergreen dioecious shrub that is heavily overexploited for its perfumery oils. Harvesting involves complete uprooting as roots are the most preferred for oil extraction. Consequently the natural occurrence of the species has declined and may eventually be depleted in some natural range. Since sustainable Osyris oils production is only feasible through domestication, there is need to understand ecological requirements of the species. The objectives of this study were to determine plant species and edaphic factors that can predict sandalwood site suitability for domestication programs. In the study, sample plots with and without Osyris were selected in forests where Sandalwood grows naturally in humid highland forests and dry lowland forests, vegetation sampled using nested-intensity plots and soils sampled in the plots simultaneously. Vegetation data was recorded according to species abundance and soil samples analyzed for nutrients content, texture and moisture retention. Vegetation data was analyzed for species association and soil data used as environmental variables through Canonical Correspondence analysis using CANOCO software. In the highlands, Sandalwood clustered with Rhus natalensis and six other species and was correlated to soil nitrogen, moisture and clay. In lowland forest, Sandalwood clustered with R. natalensis and Hypoestes forskahlii but did not correlate with any of the soil variables. The clustering of Sandalwood with Rhus natalensis in both forest types suggests its strong predictive capacity for Sandalwood site suitability in both humid and dry areas. On the contrary inconsistence of Sandalwood correlation with soil variables reveals weak predictive capacity of edaphic factors to species site suitability.\r\n \r\n",

        "description": "Declines in soil fertility and water, prolonged dry-spells/droughts and erratic climatic patterns in general continue to undermine optimal agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Drier parts of Eastern Kenya already endure low/declining soil fertility, low soil water content, increased temperatures/atmospheric heat, and unpredictable rainfall and drought patterns. These have occasioned continued declines in smallholder farm productivity (below 1 Mg ha-1 against a potential of 6-8 Mg ha-1) and resiliency. Optimizing on on-farm soil water and fertility management through conservation agriculture (CA) technologies such as sustained soil cover/residue retention, micro-dosing and minimum tillage, integrated with selected tree species (for soil fertility enhancement, fodder, firewood) may hold in upgrading and developing resiliency towards extreme climatic risks among smallholder farming systems. Redressing the problem of increased food insecurity and productivity challenges requires a farming system that maximizes on yield productivity per unit water/nutrient and/or land. This study evaluated the best integration of Gliricidia sepium and Calliandra calothyrsus in a maize inter-cropping system under conservation agriculture (CA) among smallholder farmers in dryland Eastern Kenya, using completely randomized block design trials, where CA (minimum tillage) and conventional agricultural (COA) systems were evaluated. Gliricidia sepium and Calliandra calothyrsus were integrated at inter-row spacings of 4.5m, 3.0m and 1.5m; and 1m intra-row in each system in plots of 12 by 12 m, set up at the Agricultural Research Station (ATC) in Machakos, Kenya. Yield data was analyzed with mixed model of analysis of variance, treating tree species, inter/intra row tree spacing and CA/COA as fixed effects, while maize, legume, tree yield and replication were treated as random effects. Accounting for heteroscedasticity utilized modeling the covariance structure with power-of-the-mean using Genstat 14. Standard error of difference of means (SED) test (p < 0.05) was used to evaluate how significant treatments differed from each other. Results showed that Calliandra spaced at 3 or 4.5 m yielded significantly (p= 0.003 and 0.01) higher maize yield when compared to spacing Calliandra at 1.5. Yields (Grain=5.31 and stover=5.66 Mg ha-1) in Gliricidia spaced at 4.5 m were significantly (p=0.01) higher compared to yield in any other treatments tested. No significant (p=0.136) differences occurred in maize yields under CA or COA as sole and on integration with tree species. Yields at researcher managed trials were more than those at on farm trials, whereas in both, productivity of biomass; growth of canopy; heights and tree circumference were enhanced in CA than COA.",

        "title": "Development of an adaptive sawmill-flow simulator template for predicting results of changes at small-log sawmills",
        "description": "Reduced availability of large-diameter logs and increased wood demands have resulted in smaller-diameter logs entering sawmills. The design and operation of a modern small-log sawmill requires skills different from those needed in a large-log sawmill. Because the log size is small and lumber production per log is low, production must be high Profitable sawing of small diameter logs requires high speed processing, use of curve sawing, careful log-geometry and orientation consideration before sawing. Numerous simulation studies investigated sawing process of large-diameter logs. Only a limited number of simulators addressed processing of small-diameter logs. Further, these e simulators concentrated on improving either the lumber volume yield or the lumber grade/value from logs. The modelling of entire sawmill operations has been far less extensive. The sawmill-flow simulator template (SFST) developed in this study by the author is a unique modelling package that can be used to predict results of changes at small-log sawmills. The SFST encompasses log\u00e2\u20ac\u201csawing and sawmill-flow logics. The log-sawing logic is performed by SAWSIM, and the sawmill-flow logic utilizes Arena software. A simulation template end\u00e2\u20ac\u201cuser interface was designed in Excel spreadsheets. The template holds the log-sawing solutions and sawmill-flow logic data.  A Visual Basic for Application program serves as the interface between Excel spreadsheets and the SFST. The SFST was validated using data collected at a study mill. Validation results showed that most performance factors at the study sawmill fell within one standard deviation of the corresponding mean of the simulated variables. The SFST validity ensures users that information derived by the model is valid and can be used as a basis for making decisions. The SFST may be utilized for a variety of uses. These include predicting the impact of changes in mill layout, raw material and product specifications, sawing solutions, and queue sizes on performance measures of the mill. This helps the sawmiller to make well-informed decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "A study to investigate the impact of Drum-Buffer-Rope scheduling system on sawmills performance was conducted at Sao hill sawmill near Mafinga town in Mufindi District. A total of 30 logs were used in the study. A sample of 15 logs was sawn under traditional scheduling system (i.e. system used at the study sawmill) and other 15 logs under Drum- Buffer- Rope (DBR) scheduling systems. Cycle time, throughput and work in process (WIP) for both systems were analysed using t-test of paired sample in Microsoft Excel computer programme. Results from the study showed that there were no statistical difference in cycle time (P>0.05) and work in process (P>0.05) between DBR and Traditional scheduling systems. However, the difference in the two predictors were mathematically vivid i.e. cycle time for DBR and Traditional scheduling system were 0.357 and 0.405 respectively while work in process inventory for DBR and Traditional scheduling systems were 4.46m and 5.83m respectively. These differences affected the throughput notably. The throughput for DBR and Traditional scheduling system were significantly different (P< 0.05). Therefore, application of DBR scheduling system improved productivity of the study mill by increasing throughput by 19%, lowering cycle time and work in process inventory by 12% and 23.5% respectively. From the shown improvement gains in throughput, cycle times and work in process, there is need for sawmills to shift to DBR scheduling system from mere production lines.\r\n",

        "description": "The concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cost of quality\u00e2\u20ac\u009d emerged in the 1950s and is relatively new or absent in developing countries like Tanzania. Developed countries have benefited from the advantages of using this concept to gain competitive edge above others. Traditionally, the reporting of quality-related costs had been limited to inspection and testing while all other costs like scrap and rework, customer complaints and returns, product recalls and others were accumulated in overhead accounts. Such systems are too aggregated and too distorted to be relevant for managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 planning and quality control decisions. They provide little help for reducing costs and improving both quality and productivity. Experience from the Sawmill industry in Tanzania indicates that most sawmills report quality related costs in a traditional way. A change is inevitable if sawmills are to live to customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expectations. This study is an effort towards initiating such a system in the sawmill industry in Tanzania. The study observed that there was no cost of quality reporting system at the study mill and costs of quality at the mill were rising. Annually, on average, there was a cost increase of 10, 21 and 10 % on prevention, appraisal and internal failures. The production department was found to be the main source (78%) of quality costs. The activities in the department that were found to contribute more  to quality problems included downgrading of lumber due to poor quality(27%), maintenance of saws (18%), reworking/resawing (12%), process control (10%), and test and inspection (12%). These areas could serve as a starting point for a quality improvement programme. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "The study compared two policies on mill-wane allowance, i.e. the current mill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wane allowance and the maximum wane allowance allowed by the Western Wood Products Association (WWPA) stud-grade rules. Different levels of wane-allowance may have different impacts on lumber recovery, grade recovery, production, machine utilization, profit, and flow of lumber. Increasing the allowable proportion of wane on lumber should increase lumber recovery and production. However, increased proportions of wane on lumber lower its grade and thus its price. The question is, would this gain in recovery and production be large enough to offset lower prices for high-waned lumber? The sawmill-flow simulator template (SFST) was used to model the study mill and investigate the impact of changing the mill-wane policy. Employing the maximum wane allowance allowed by WWPA grade rules, lumber production increased from the current 393.55 m3 to 416.54 m3. Also, with more wane, the recovery rate and lumber recovery factor increased by 5.9% and 5.7%, respectively.  However, regardless of the increases, it was found that there was no need to change the wane allowance, because with the current wane allowance the mill generated $2,364 more per shift than did with the maximum WWPA wane allowance. In addition, the model identified the debarker machine as a bottleneck in lumber production at the study mill. By increasing the debarker speed by 10%, and maintain the current wane allowance, an average of $4,279 per shift more profit and a more synchronised mill-flow could be achieved. Managers need timely and comprehensive information on which to base important decisions. Simulation provides a method to rapidly conduct experiments that predict results of alternative manufacturing decisions. In deciding which wane allowance to use, no raw materials, no machine times, no human resources, and no production time were utilized to reach the decision. That is the real power of simulation as a decision tool.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "<p>Lack of capital for investment and expansion has been the underlying obstacle to successful development of most sawmills, especially those in developing countries. Inefficient utilization of the raw material contributes significantly to the problem. This study evaluated the sawing processes at Sao Hill Timbers, Ltd; and identified ways to improve conversion efficiency and sales. The study was directed at measures which would not require capital investments or additional raw materials. Such measures included reduction of lumber target size, sawing variations, and sizes of saw kerfs. The volumes of lumber, slabs, edgings, and sawdust produced from the logs were measured. Lumber-size analysis was performed. The study results showed that material balance was as follows: lumber (45.80%), slabs and edgings (27.74%), sawdust (13.10%). trimmings (4.12%), and bark (9.25%). Results from lumber-size analysis showed that 100% of the lumber pieces studied were sawn oversize. This resulted in 14.4% of the lumber volume produced being wasted as planer shavings. The within-board, between- boards, and total sawing variations were 1.1, 0.69, and 1.29 mm respectively. These sawing variation values were on the high side compared to results from other studies. The teeth of saws were on average sprung wider by 25.26 % over the theoretical teeth sets. The study found that reduction of lumber target size, total sawing variation, and heardrig saw kerf could improve conversion efficiency from the current 45.8% to 59.26% and would increase sales by 199, 507,000 Tsh per annum.</p>",

        "description": "Rural households have over decades depended on forests and forest products for sustenance and livelihood values. This dependence is usually driven by the individual household\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dynamics, forests availability and accessibility. However, with overexploitation and agricultural expansion, these forests are rapidly declining putting in peril household livelihoods. This study aims at examining and analyzing household dynamics and how these dynamics combine with other factors to influence household dependence on forest resources in the Rumpi hills of Cameroon. Data were collected from 484 households, across 20 villages and at four selected sites through household surveys and 20 focus group discussions. Household characteristics such as uneducated heads (p-value 0.000381) significantly influenced the use of forest resources than male heads (P-value 0.000642) and years of residence (11\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15) (p-value 0.00624) in the village at the 95% level of significance. Forest dependence was mostly conditioned by the household\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to farm, forest abundance, and unemployment. Additionally, income from agriculture and forest resources respectively constituted 36.7% and 34.1% of the average total rural household income. Investment in climate-smart agriculture, non-wood domestic cooking energy, agroforestry systems and reliable rural transport systems is necessary in order to curb forest dependence and improve on livelihoods and sustainable forest management initiatives.",

        "description": "Trace metal profile of Moringa oleifera seedlings grown in spent lubricating oil contaminated soil was evaluated in Asaba, Delta State, Nigeria during the 2012 growing season. Oil concentrations used were 0.00, 1.37, 2.77, 4.15 and 6.92% (w/w). The results showed that spent lubricating oil in soil significantly (P\u00e2\u2030\u00a40.05) increased trace metals in soil and Maringa oleifera plant tissues relative to the control. Trace metal identified included Pb, Fe, Zn and Cu and their values were significantly (P\u00e2\u2030\u00a40.05) higher when compared with values obtained from the uncontaminated soils. The results also showed that the amount of trace metals accumulated is dose-dependant as the values obtained in higher concentrations of oil application were significantly (P \u00e2\u2030\u00a40.05) higher than values recorded in the control subplots. This study has demonstrated that spent lubricating oil leads to gradual accumulation of trace metals in soils and plant tissues which could have health risk in the Nigeria rural environment especially in the Niger Delta where oil activities are predominant.",

        "description": "<p>Abstract Climate-related environmental and humanitarian crisis are important challenges in the Great Horn of Africa (GHA). In the absence of long-term past climate records in the region, tree-rings are valuable climate proxies, reflecting past climate variations and complementing climate records prior to the instrumental era. We established annually resolved multi-century tree-ring chronology from Juniperus procera trees in northern Ethiopia, the longest series yet for the GHA. The chronology correlates significantly with wet-season (r = .64, p &lt; .01) and annual (r = .68, p &lt; .01) regional rainfall. Reconstructed rainfall since A.D. 1811 revealed significant interannual varia- tions between 2.2 and 3.8 year periodicity, with significant decadal and multidecadal variations during 1855&ndash;1900 and 1960&ndash;1990. The duration of negative and positive rainfall anomalies varied between 1&ndash;7 years and 1&ndash;8 years. Approximately 78.4% (95%) of reconstructed dry (extreme dry) and 85.4% (95%) of wet (extreme wet) events lasted for 1 year only and corresponded to historical records of famine and flooding, suggesting that future climate change studies should be both trend and extreme event focused. The average return periods for dry (extreme dry) and wet (extreme wet) events were 4.1 (8.8) years and 4.1 (9.5) years. Extreme-dry condi- tions during the 19th century were concurrent with drought episodes in equatorial eastern Africa that occurred at the end of the Little Ice Age. El Nino and La Nina events matched with 38.5% and 50% of extreme-dry and extreme-wet events. Equivalent matches for positive and negative Indian Ocean Dipole events were weaker, reaching 23.1 and 25%, respectively. Spatial correlations revealed that reconstructed rainfall represents wet-season rainfall variations over northern Ethio- pia and large parts of the Sahel belt. The data presented are useful for backcasting climate and hydrological models and for developing regional strategic plans to man- age scarce and contested water resources. Historical perspectives on long-term regional rainfall variability improve the interpretation of recent climate trends.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Abstract<br />Niger is critically affected by climate change due to its high dependence on climate-sensitive<br />sectors which include agriculture and livestock. Thus, efficient management of biodiversity<br />and sustainable conservation of ecosystems should be a major concern. In this context,<br />several practices that include agro-forestry ones have been developed to overcome the<br />vulnerability of climate change. The overall objective of this study is to contribute to the<br />capitalization of experiences and good practices in agro-forestry for climate adaptation and<br />mitigation of Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To this end, specific objectives involve<br />gathering peasant perception of climate vulnerability, identifying good agro-forestry<br />practices and analyzing their contributions to the adaptation and mitigation of climate<br />change; finally propose a mechanism of diffusion and recovery of these agro-forestry<br />practices. Basically the methodology consists of surveys addressed to farmers, technical<br />services and resource persons with agro-forestry backgrounds. People perceptions reveal the<br />fact that recent years are characterized by very high temperatures, lower agricultural yields,<br />fragile environment and so on. Seven (7) agro-forestry practices have been identified in the<br />survey of study area: the RNA, the hedge life Moringa oleifera, the hedge to Lawsonia<br />inermis, intercropping in Australian Acacia, hedge Acacia senegal, apisylviculture fruit<br />growing associated with market gardening. These practices have a considerable socioeconomic<br />value in Niger; they strengthen the adaptive capacity of farmers to environmental<br />and economic crises and cope with the food insecurity, and can obviously contribute to the<br />mitigation of GHG. However, the investment cost, climatic hazards, poverty and lack of<br />incentive policies are seriously endangering the future of these practices.<br />Tags: agro-forestry, adaptation, mitigation, climate change.Publication Description</p>",

        "description": "<p>Documentation was undertaken of beekeepers&rsquo; socio-economic and technical circumstances in selected areas of Baringo District, Rift Valley Province, Kenya. Results showed that beekeeping is mainly based on the traditional log hive technology. Beekeepers individually manufactured most of the equipment they required. They trained each other and contacted one another readily for technical advice. Modernization of the beekeeping industry has been attempted with the introduction of Kenya Top Bar Hives but is not widely adopted. There is little contact between the technical agents of modern beekeeping and the local beekeepers under the present circumstances. After establishing that traditional management follows different principles from the modern approach, it became clear that the one type of management could not simply be superimposed on the other. Beekeepers requested for further training in bee husbandry, life cycle of the honeybee and wished to learn how to use modern hives. The most serious problems encountered by beekeepers were frequent disturbance of bees by pests and occasional theft, poor marketing infrastructure and lack of water. A new government extension policy seeks to strengthen research-farmer-extension linkages. It also encourages involvement of private sector partners in providing this essential service in situations where the beekeepers cannot be effectively served by the public sector. The future emphasis of extension should be training of beekeepers in modern methods of beekeeping, including improved harvesting and processing techniques, to empower them to produce high quality products that can be readily channeled out of the area to wider external markets. The scope for research is very wide as modernization requires fundamental bee, plant and environmental factors to be well understood. Partners with a long-term commitment to beekeeping research are lacking. As such, the challenge remains for the institutions that are actively engaged in related research to review their future research priorities in the area.</p>",

        "description": "Survival of seedlings in arid zone plantation is strongly affected by water stress and drought conditions. Many tree species are able to develop adaptive mechanisms in response to drought stress. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of imposed drought stress on seedlings growth, water use efficiency and survival of three arid zone species (Acacia tortilis subsp raddiana, Salvadora persica and Leptadenia pyrotechnica). Three successive drought cycles were imposed, to a five months old seedlings of the three species. At the end of the drought cycles treatment, water was withheld from both well watered and stressed seedlings and survival was counted until all seedlings wilted out. Growth traits and WUE were measured in drought treated and untreated seedlings.The results showed that imposed drought stress enhanced adaptive traits on these seedlings resulting in better survival. Drought treatment significantly reduced growth traits and WUE in the three species and increased root to shoot ratio and survival. The results pointed out that drought stress conditioning enhanced adaptive traits for these species. However, response was varied among species. S. persica showed better growth than A. tortilis and L. pyrotechnica, alternatively survival was better in A. tortilis and L. pyrotechnica than S. Persica. These results may suggest that in severe drought-prone sites A. tortilis and L. pyrotechnica are preferred.\r\nKeyword: drought cycles, adaptive response, biomass partitioning, WUE, survival.",

        "description": "Abstract\r\nWater and salinity are main co-occurring stresses affecting plant growth and development in arid lands. In this study interactive effects of water and salinity stresses on Balanites aegyptiaca seedlings from three different sources (SD5.1, SD6.2 and KSA) were assessed in potted experiment under greenhouse conditions. The effect was measured on stomatal conductance (Gs), specific leaf area (SLA), seedling quality (Shoot to Root ratio (S/R), Dickson Quality Index (DQI) and Sturdiness Quotient (SQ)), Nutrient uptake (N content, K/Na and Ca/Na ratios) and growth. The seedlings were either watered twice a week (well\r\nwatered) or every two weeks (water stressed), in addition to four salt concentrations (fresh water as control, 5 dS m-1, 7 dS m-1 and 9 dS m-1 EC). Water and salinity stresses resulted in reduced Gs, SLA, DQ, SQ and S/R, associated with lower height and root collar diameter. However, irrespective of salt concentration, water stressed seedlings displayed substantial reduction in Gs, indicating that Gs is among the most important water conservation strategy for this species. S/R also, remarkably decreased in water stressed seedlings, but, within watering treatment it was increased with increasing salt concentration. SLA and DQI were more affected by salinity stress, due to the increased leaf weight with increasing salinity. N content was more sensitive to water stress than salinity. Both Ca/Na and K/Na ratios were decreased with increasing salt concentration. The three sources exhibited significant variation in their response to water and salinity stresses. SD5.1 displayed higher values in most of studied traits. Gs and S/R may be considered as fitness responses of this species to water stress, while DQI, SLA and K/Na can\r\nserve as good indicators to measure response to salt stress.\r\n\r\nKey words: Stomatal conductance, Shoot to root ratio, Dickson quality index, Sturdiness quotient, K/Na ratio, Water stress, Salinity stress.",

        "description": "A greenhouse experiment was conducted at the Agricultural Research Station, King Abdulaziz University to examine the effects of salinity on biomass production, physiological responses, mineral uptake, leaves quality (protein, fiber, ash) and tannin content. A 4 months old seedlings were exposed to an increasing salt concentrations: (Bore well water, 7, 9 and 12 dS/m, respectively). Physiological traits Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Leaf Dry Matter Content (LDMC) and Relative Water Content (RWC)) were measured at different growth development. Leaves minerals (N, P, Na, Ca, K, Mg), protein, fiber and ash contents were analyzed. Condensed tannins were assayed by vanillin HCI method. The results showed that salinity resulted in reduced biomass production and growth in response to lower SLA, lower RWC and higher LDMC with increasing salt concentrations. The salts accumulation in soil media resulted in higher Na associated with lower (N, P, Ca, K, Mg) contents in leaves, while tannin was increased with increasing salt concentration. Protein, ash and fiber contents were significantly differed among salt treatments. Despite the effects of salt stress on growth, the relatively good performance of the seedlings under all\r\nlevels of salt concentrations indicates that this species has adaptive mechanisms to withstand relatively high levels of salinity.\r\nKeywords: Biomass production, relative water content, salinity, specific leaf area, tannins",

        "description": "Different levels of salt concentrations (control, 5, 8 and 10 dS m-1) were subjected to three varied sources of Balanites aegyptiaca, namely SD1, SD2 and KSA under greenhouse conditions. The aim was to investigate the effect of salinity on growth, physiological responses and chemical properties and to examine variability among the three sources. The following parameters were studied: stomatal conductance (Gs), relative water content (RWC), specific leaf area (SLA), condensed tannin and minerals (N, P, Na, Ka, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn), in addition to growth and biomass production. The results revealed that under saline soil seedlings showed lower growth and biomass production, associated with reduced Gs, SLA and RWC. The effect was increased with increasing salinity. In lower salinity (control and concentration 5 dS m-1), SD1 obtained higher Gs values, while under higher\r\nconcentrations KSA revealed higher Gs values. It was also noticed that the level of Na in the leaves was increased with increasing salt accumulation in the soil accompanied by decreased N and K contents. Tannin significantly differed among the sources and increased with increasing salinity. The three sources significantly varied in most of the parameters recorded, whereas the interactions between salt treatments and sources were only\r\nsignificant for Gs, indicating that source ranking was consistent in most parameters. SD1 obtained higher values in most of the parameters. With regards to response to salinity, the differences among the three sources highlighted variability in salt tolerance among different intra-specific sources of this species.\r\n\r\nKey words: Stomatal conductance, relative water content, specific leaf area, tannin, mineral accumulation, salt stress, sources.\r\n",

Growth responses were\r\nmeasured on leaf traits (leaf Area (LA), Specific Leaf Area (SLA), Leaf Dry Matter Content\r\n(LDMC) and Leaf Relative Water Content (LRWC)) and Stomatal conductance (Gs). While\r\nforage productivity was assessed on leaf area index (LAI), fresh and dry forage yield (tons/ha) and forage quality (Protein, minerals, fiber and ash). The results showed that addition of fertilizers were significantly increased forage yield and quality over control untreated plots. Cow manure at the rate of 40 tons/ha obtained close values to the NPK in most of the studied parameters. High positive correlations co-efficient was observed between forage production with LAI, LA, SLA, LRWC and Gs and negative correlation with LDMC. The increase in LDMC and reduction of Gs and other leaf traits in hot summer season were associated withlow forage productivity. However, this may be related to adaptive mechanisms of this species to withstand harsh conditions. The linear correlation of LAI with forage yield reflects that LAI is good indicator to estimate growth development and forage yield. The study concluded that Clitoria had potential adaptive mechanisms as forage crop in dry arid conditions. The production can be increased by application of organic fertilizers.\r\nKeyword: forage yield, Leaf area index, Leaf traits, organic fertilization, stomatal conductance",

        "description": "Leucaena leicocephala - Clitoria ternatea intercropping under arid dry saline soils was carried out during the period 2010-2012. The aim was to test the effect of tree/ crop productivity and interactions. Crop parameters measured were; relative growth rate (RGR), forage yield, quality and stomatal conductance (gs). Where tree parameters are; height and\r\ndiameter growth and increase per month. In addition to tree and crop leaf area index (LAI) and soil chemical properties.The study showed that intercropping resulted in reduced crop forage yield and RGR, compared to sole crop. While, protein and most of the minerals were higher and fiber was lower in intercropped forage. Tree growth was remarkably higher under intercropping compared to sole crop. Strong relationship between LAI with tree and crop productivity was observed. Higher values of LAI were associated with higher crop and tree growth. Crop gs was significantly higher in sole crop compared to intercrop, whereas lower gs values were observed in mixed plots with higher tree LAI. Soil\r\norganic matter was higher in mixed cropped plots associated with lower soil EC and Na and Higher N, K, Ca and Mg.\r\nThe study concluded that the presence of Clitoria had beneficial effects on tree growth, where the trees had negative effects on crop forage productivity and RGR.\r\n\r\nKey words: LAI, stomatal conductance, intercropping, productivity.",

        "description": "Culturally, sacred forests have been an integral part of many Africa traditional societies for centuries.For decades, these traditions have encouraged community driven nature conservation attitudes and have ensured the conservation of native biodiversity, supplying non-timber forest products (NTFPs),supporting ecological, religious, cultural and socio-economic functions. This long standing tradition ison the decline today as a result of development, population pressure and changes in religious beliefs.This study examines the cultural and socio-economic variables that facilitate the conservation of the sacred forests in Asanting village in Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area (LGA) in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. Seventy five (75) respondents were selected for this study using snowball sampling and\r\nstratified sampling techniques, and were used to collect the quantitative and qualitative data through a questionnaire survey and ethnographic research approaches. Descriptive statistical techniques were used to analyze the primary data collected. The results show that 73% were male and 27% were female,60% were literate while 40% were traders and 33% were farmers with 4% less than 30 years old. All the respondents belong to a single religious group (Christianity). Majority of the respondents (79%) had favorable attitudes towards the concept of conservation of the fragments of sacred forest through cultural practices. Fourteen percent of the respondents agreed that they need to conserve the sacred\r\nforest because of its regulating, provisioning, social/cultural and supporting services. Moreover, a largeproportion of the respondents (71%) generate income from various activities carried out within the sacred forests, thus, contributing to their livelihoods economy. However, changes in religious beliefs and the need for development had a negative effect on the conservation attitude of majority of the respondents, leading to the destruction of two sacred forests in the village. The integration of the traditional knowledge system in enlightenment campaign and application of community based approach toward conservation issues will therefore ensure a better conservation attitude in the\r\ncommunity and Nigeria in general.",

        "description": "ABSTRACT: This study was carried out to examine the variation in the abundance of tree and insect species in some selected forest reserves in Ondo State Nigeria. The study also examined the relationship between soil mesofauna, tree and the insect species. Eight sample plots (20 m by 40 m) were demarcated where enumeration of trees species, sampling of insets, and collection of soil samples were carried out. A total number of 1167 woody trees species were encountered from all forest reserves, distributed in to 360, 371, 274, and 162 in Akure/Ofosu, Oluwa, Akure Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forest and Owo forest reserves  espectively. Shannon-Wiener diversity index values are 3.60, 3.57, 3.34 and 3.31 for Oluwa, Akure/Ofosu, Owo and Akure Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forest reserves respectively. Trees species richness was higher in Oluwa forest reserve (61), and the least was found in Owo (38). Then were nine hundred and fifty six (956) insects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 species with 123, 234, 236 and 363 in Owo, Akure/Ofosu, Oluwa and Akure (Queen) forest reserve respectively. Shannon-Weiner diversity index values for the reserves were 3.07, 3.08 3.17 and 3.31 for Owo, Akure/ Ofosu, Oluwa and Akure Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forest reserves were respectively. Insects\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 species richness was highest in Akure Queens forest (36) while the least was found in Owo (26). The results of soil mesofauna shows that 309 mesofauna were recorded in the Oluwa forest, 250, 233 and 115 were encountered in Akure/Ofosu, Akure Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Owo forest reserves respectively. The correlation coefficient between insects and mesofauna was positive and high (0.7747). However the correlation coefficient between trees and insects abundance was negative (-0.3800) while those of trees and mesofauna abundance was positive but low (0.1120). Suggestions were made on how our forest can be managed sustainably.",

        "description": "Abstract In the past, Mau forest complex has faced a wide range of disturbances majorly anthropogenic in nature. In this paper, the ecosystem floristic composition, richness, diversity and affinities are evaluated. Diameter at breast height (dbh) was measured and types and levels of disturbances recorded in plots, dbh of saplings measured in subplots and seedlings counted in microplots. To obtain the floristic composition and richness, we categorized species based on their families, development stages and life forms. Shannon-Wiener information index (H\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) and Jaccard (JIA) and Sorensen(S) similarity indices were used to evaluate the species diversity and similarity respectively Trees, recorded belonged to 52 species, 45 genera and 31 families for seedlings; 43 species, 38 genera and 29 families for saplings and 55 species, 48 genera and 31 families for mature trees. The most species-rich family was rutaceae with six species followed by moraceae and flacourtiaceae with five. Western Kedowa had the highest diversity. Northern and Western Kedowa were the most similar pairs. Past and present disturbances and aggressive proliferation of the invasive; Trichocladus ellipticus (Eckl. and Zeyh) are the main causes of low species diversity and richness. In conclusion, the sites are floristically dissimilar but at varying degrees. The post-disturbance recovery on different sites is following different trajectory successional pathways. We recommend that the on-going disturbances should be curtailed to promote regeneration and successful recruitment of non-pioneer species. \r\n",

        "description": "This paper evaluates the combustion properties of fuelwood and pyrolytic products from three selected sawmill wood residues - Gmelina arborea, Terminalia superba and Triplochiton scleroxylon. Pyrolysis experiments were performed at 450, 500 and 550\u00c2\u00b0C. The percentage oil, pH, viscosities were considered. The highest yield of oil yield was at 550\u00c2\u00b0C (45.70%) for Triplochiton scleroxylon out of the three sawmill wood residues. The analysis of variance conducted on pyrolytic oil produced at 450, 500 and 550\u00c2\u00b0C for the G. arborea, and T. scleroxylon showed no significant difference but there were significant differences in the pH and viscosity of the pyrolytic liquid produced from selected wood species at the same conversion temperatures. The result showed the proximate analysis of the selected wood residues with the ash content (2.75, 2.61, and 3.57 %); fixed carbon (10.52, 12.07 and 10.23%); volatile (87.55, 85.48 and 86.46%) and heating value of 32792.75, 32691.56 and 32794.15 KJ/kg for Gmelina arborea, Terminalia superba and Triplochiton scleroxylon respectively. Proximate analysis results showed that the selected wood residues have good potential for domestic cooking and the characterized pyrolytic oil produced for biofuel production, most importantly for bioenergy sustainable system.

        "description": "<p>Pyrolysis experiments on wood residue were conducted to characterize pyrolytic oil from sawmill wood residues of three selected tree species (Gmelina arborea, Terminalia superba and Triplochiton scleroxylon). Pyrolysis was performed at various temperatures: 450, 500 and 550&deg;C. The functional groups present in the pyrolytic oil obtained at different temperature conditions were identified using Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analysis. Chemical composition of the pyrolytic liquid was dominated by oxygenated compound like carboxylic and alcoholic groups resulting from the pyrolysis of the cellulose and phenolic and methoxy groups produced by pyrolysis of the lignin.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Madagascar is currently developing a policy and strategies to enhance the sustainable management of its natural resources, encouraged by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and REDD. To set up a sustainable financing scheme methodologies have to be provided that estimate, prevent and mitigate leakage, develop national and regional baselines, and estimate carbon benefits. With this research study this challenge was tried to be addressed by analysing a lowland rainforest in the Analanjirofo region in the district of Soanierana Ivongo, North East of Madagascar. For two distinguished forest degradation stages: &lsquo;&lsquo;low degraded forest&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;degraded forest&rsquo;&rsquo; aboveground biomass and carbon stock was assessed. The corresponding rates of carbon within those two classes were calculated and linked to a multi-temporal set of SPOT satellite data acquired in 1991, 2004 and 2009. Deforestation and particularly degradation and the related carbon stock developments were analysed. With the assessed data for the 3 years 1991, 2004 and 2009 it was possible to model a baseline and to develop a forest prediction for 2020 for Analanjirofo region in the district of Soanierana Ivongo. These results, developed applying robust methods, may provide important spatial information regarding the priorities in planning and implementation of future REDD+ activities in the area.</p>",

        "description": "<p>One of the key features of Kenya&rsquo;s Forest Act (2005) is Participatory Forest Management (PFM) where the management and conservation of forest resources must involve the communities around the forest resource. Participatory Forest management requires that local communities be engaged in the management and conservation activities through Community Forest Associations (CFAs). We carried out an assessment of the roles of CFAs and their objectives within the Kakamega forest landscape using a structured questionnaire. Our findings clearly show that 90 per cent of the CFAs and CBOs in the Kakamega Forest landscape are engaged in activities that are aimed at creating employment, poverty reduction, and improvements of livelihoods of the communities around the forest through sustainable utilization, conservation and management of Kakamega forest resources. Major activities of the Community-based organizations under the umbrella CFAS include public awareness, tree planting, bee keeping, and ecotourism among others. Given the level of engagement of the local communities in forest management and conservation activities, there has been a significant improvement in forest cover. The study concludes that more funding is needed for capacity training for CFAs and CBOs to enhance and fortify their forest management and conservation skills and activities whose results are clearly evident. Strengthening of CFAs and CBOs is a sure way of conserving of our water towers and increasing forest cover to the recommended 10% as stipulated in the new constitution and to help Mitigate against the effects of climate change.</p>",

Ethanolic extracts of C. lusitanica and C. papaya totally inhibited the growth of B. dothiorella and C. gloeosporioides at 4 mg/ml and that of C. purpurea at 5.5 mg/ml; the two extracts were fungicidal at these concentrations. In vivo tests showed that C. lusitanica and C. papaya extracts completely inhibited the development of pathogens on avocado fruits 5 days experimental period whereas the extracts of E. floribundus lost their efficacy.

        "description": "<p>GPS and GIS are becoming very important in the world of Agriculture today, Experts claim that effective used of GPS/GIS can increase food production by more than 50%.The third forum organized by the European Commission, Government of Spain, CTA, German International Cooperation (giz), France Development Agency (afd), Irish Aid and Global Donor Platform for Rural Development had the theme &ldquo;Rural Development for food security &ndash; learning from experience&rdquo;. It brought together about 500 representatives from international organizations, governments, academia and the civil society to deliberate on cross-cutting issues toward ensuring food security across the continent. Soraja Rodriguez Ramos emphasized the importance of incorporating the role of women in agriculture across the continent. She made it clear that the world, especially developing countries need right equality policies that would empower women to contribute towards ensuring food security and overall rural development. Apart from acknowledging the role of the Ghanaian woman in agriculture, she lamented women lacked the capacity to produce more because of unfavorable government policies and logistical challenges. The world over GPS is used for precession farming and site specific crop management; precession farming increase yield, reduce production cost and minimise negative impact to the environment. Site specific data such as soil characteristics, fertility and nutrient data, topographic and drainage characteristics, yield data, this are normally collected from different source of fields and stored and managed in a spatial database, either contained within GIS or connected to GIS externally. The research practically employed GPS and GIS applications in farming where 150 women vegetable farmers in Shama District went through the process of training, cropping and analyzing data using GPS/GIS the results was evident enough that many farmers have resorted in adapting the technology in farming.</p>",

According to obtained data the P. hypostoma, was more existent at most temperature degrees, followed by A. ochraceus, which distributed in lower temperatures of soil, but the subterranean termite A. desertorum, was very limited and confined with high soil temperature degrees. On the other hand obtained data clarified that, the subterranean termite P. hypostoma found in most variable relative humidity degrees of soil ranged from 27.5-80.5Rh, while the subterranean termite, A. ochraceus was found in some areas with variable Rh degrees of soil ranged from 49.5-66.9. Also the subterranean termite A. desertorum was found with Rh degrees of soil ranged from 41-49.5. According to obtained data the P. hypostoma, was more existent at most Rh degrees, followed by A. ochraceus, but the subterranean termite A. desertorum, was very limited and confined with low range of Rh degrees of soil. As a general trend there is relationship between termite distribution and the tested factors and the subterranean termite can be life in long rang of temperatures and relative humidity.",

This is the output one of the ACTION PLAN titled: - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Response of Local Rice Genotypes against Salinity and Low N & P in arid and semi arid areas of Tanzania\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which was developed during the training. The research was conducted in Korogwe and Mvomero district, Tanzania to identify the indigenous management options of secondary salinization in irrigation schemes of arid and semi arid areas. The data were collected using two methods which were scoping and workshop meeting with farmers groups and rice crop stakeholders selected from irrigation schemes of Mvomero and Korogwe district. The indigenous management options for secondary salinization in Mvomero and Korogwe districts were collected through presentation that were made by farmers groups and District Agricultural and Livestock Development Office (DALDOs) from irrigation schemes affected by  secondary salinity in Mvomero and Korogwe district. Main findings were identification of area under affected by secondary salinization, available indigenous management options and the current cropping calendar of rice crop in Mvomero and Korogwe district. In Korogwe, the estimated area which is affected secondary salinization is 4.1% of the total potential land for irrigation and there was only 49.9% of the potential area for irrigation has been used in the district. While in Mvomero district the estimated area affected with secondary salinization was 9.6% of the total potential land for irrigation and only 34.9% of potential area for irrigation has been used in Mvomero district. Many indigenous management options ranging from biological, chemical, physical and hydraulic management practices were collected from both Mvomero and Korogwe district. Chemical management options involved field application of ashes from paddy husk and gypsum; biological management options involved use of organic manure and mulching with paddy husks; physical management options involved land scraping and field leveling while hydraulic management option were flashing of SASs fields with clean water and rehabilitation of irrigation systems. These indigenous management options are improving farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yield while improving soil physical and chemical properties, though more scientific research desires to investigate on the chemical and biological effect of these materials in management of saline soil with low N and P is vital in irrigated rice schemes of arid and semi arid of Tanzania. Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency these local biological and chemicals materials (ashes made from rice husks, gypsum, paddy husks, cow dung manure and mixed organic manure) in managing salinity and low N and P in Tanzania. A research project that encompasses evaluation and estimation of application rates of these biological and chemical materials from Tanzania and nearby country also indispensable in the country to manage the problem which is fast growing in arid and semi arid areas of Tanzania.\r\n",

        "description": "Arsenic Availability And Microbial Functional Diversity As Influenced By Different Plant Covers In Calcareous Soils Of Central Italy\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nViterbo is naturally polluted with arsenic as a result of geochemical mobilization through hydrothermal processes that lead to the up flow of thermal waters. The area is characterised by thermal springs with arsenic concentrations ranging from 180 to 370 \u00ce\u00bcg L-1. and the soils are calcareous. Five samples were analysed chemically and biochemically to assess the distribution and bioavailability of arsenic in the soil, the effect of plant cover on its distribution and the microbial functional diversity in response to arsenic. The sampling points were the control (near the thermal prings), Pinus halepensis, Quercus spp., Mediterranean maquis and the not-planted areas all found in botanical gardens of the University of Tuscia. The results reflected a considerable amount of arsenic associated to the CaCO3 fraction which may become unstable under changing environmental conditions. The presence of different plant covers affects the arsenic content in the soil differently as was evident in the drastic reduction of As content in the conifer plant (Pinus halepensis) cover. The presence of plant products favours a higher functional diversity of microbial processes as opposed to the drastic reduction in microbial functional diversity observed in the control site where there CaCO3 content is elevated and there are not plants. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Arsenic, calcareous soils, bio-availability, plant uptake, microbial functional diversity\r\n",

        "description": "This paper examined the Grain Farmers Challenges to Climate Change Adaptation Strategies in Goronyo Local Government Area of Sokoto State. It highlighted the critical challenges faced by grain farmers in trying to adapt to the problem of climate change. Daily rainfall and temperature data for 30 years (1981-2010) were sourced from the Sokoto Rima Basin Development Authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rainfall Reading Office, Goronyo and the Nigerian Meteorological Services (NIMET), Lagos. These data were used to derive the rainfall characteristics of Goronyo which are very crucial in plant growth and development. 382 grain farmers were sampled. The grain farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 characteristics were considered. Open ended questions were used to ask farmers of their challenges to climate change adaptation strategies. The farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perceptions to climate change are in line with climatic data records. The characterisation of the climate of the study area showed an increasing trend in the onset and cessation dates. To cope with the changing climate, grain farmers in the study area adopted some adaptive measures. The main challenges to climate change adaptation strategies in the study area are: inadequate education, information and training on climate change issues; inadequate access to improved seed varieties; lack of access to water for irrigation; scanty and ill-equipped weather stations; unstable government policies on agriculture etc. The study concludes that the climatic characteristics of the study area affect grain production and that adaptation strategies have significant contribution on grain production in the study area. The study therefore advocates that there should be explicit national agricultural policy framework, adequate provision for irrigation, weather forecasting and other agricultural technological infrastructure, an incentive for training in agriculture, drought resistant and short duration high yielding crops development, integration of indigenous and modern knowledge on climate change adaptation, strengthening of the extension services, and encouragement of formation of farmer groups.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Adaptation strategies, Climate Change, Grain farmers, Goronyo\r\n",

Daily rainfall and temperature \r\ndata for 30 years (1981-2010) were sourced from the Sokoto Rima Basin Development Authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \r\nRainfall Reading  Office, Goronyo. The data received was augmented with data collected for Sokoto \r\nfrom the Nigerian Meteorological  Services (NIMET), Oshodi, Lagos. These data were used to derive \r\nthe rainfall characteristics of Goronyo such as the onset, cessation, length of rainy season, annual \r\nrainfall, mean maximum   and mean minimum temperature, which are very crucial in plant growth and \r\ndevelopment.  382 grain farmers were sampled. Open ended questions were used to ask farmers of \r\ntheir favourite crops. The sampled grain farmers were also asked whether they had perceived long term changes in rainfall and temperature and about the adap tations they had made as a response to \r\nwhatever  changes  they  had  noticed.  The  farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122  perceptions  to  climate  change  are  in  line  with \r\nclimatic  data  records.  The  characterisation  of  the  climate  of  the  study  area  showed  an  increasing \r\ntrend in the onset and cessation dates. The study revealed an upward trend in length of the rainy \r\nseason.  To cope with the changing climate, grain farmers in the study area adopted some adaptive \r\nmeasures.  The  main  adaptation  strategies  of  grain  farmers  in  Goronyo  are:  crop  rotation,  use  of \r\nimproved seed varieties, shifting cultivation, intensification   of irrigation, use of organic and inorganic \r\nmanure among others. The study concludes that the climatic characteristics of the study area affect \r\ngrain production and that adaptation strategies have significant contribution on grain production in the \r\nstudy area. The study therefore advocates that  grain farmers should adopt viable adaptive strategies \r\nto climate change so as to maximize the available land and the climatic condition that f avours their \r\ncultivation.\r\nKeywords: Adaptation strategies, Climate Change, Grain farmers, Goronyo",

        "description": "<p>Boosting knowledge through awareness raising is important in shaping on why, what, when, where, who and how one can benefit from community forest (CF) resources. Based on this assumption, this study assessed how awareness raising has influenced community participation in community forestry in South West Cameroon, with reference to two case studies. A total of 60 participants selected purposively were involved in this study and primary data was collected using interview guides, focus group discussions and field observations. Repondents&rsquo; awareness was categorised into five main themes: formation awareness, management committee awareness, management process awareness, rights awareness and benefits sharing awareness. ALAST.ti 5 was used for data analysis and the results revealed that local community members were poorly informed on how the CF came into existence, the main people involved in their management, how they were being managed and on how they could access and benefit from them. Thus, since local community members were less informed, they were unable to participate meaningfully to implementation. In this line, the study argues that for inclusive participation to be enabled in CF implementation in Cameroon, there is an inevitable need to ensure that all intended beneficiaries are well informed on the concept. We recommend that policy interventions should consider strategies that will commit CF managers and other stakeholders to ensure the full awareness of all participants. There is also a need to motivate public debates and research on how local awareness and participation can be sustainably achieved.

        "description": "This study evaluates the choices indigenous communities living adjacent areas of conservation interest face when the resources are under conservation consideration. These resources have been their main source of livelihood for decades, and it is often a hard decision to accept access restriction to what has previously been a common pool resource. Using the proposed Tofalla Hill Wildlife Sanctuary (THWS) in Southwest Cameroon, we evaluate in what ways the conservation of the critically endangered Cross River gorilla (Gorilla gorilla diehli) has affected local livelihood and vice versa. Data for this study were collected through questionnaires, interviews, focus group discussions and field observations. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were used to analyse and explain quantitative data while content analysis was used to analysed qualitative data. The results revealed that strong ancestral and cultural attachment of indigenous communities to forest and forest resources makes it difficult for them to welcome activities that will restrict access to forest resources. Further analysis also shows that forest-dependent activities had an added value to local livelihood when combine with off forest activities. The added value that off forest activities contribute to local livelihood presents an opportunity for conser- vationists to design innovative solutions that balance conservation objectives and the livelihood aspiration of the communities. This could be a reasonable entry point to address existing negative local perception on gorilla conservation approaches in the THWS.",

        "description": "Lebialem-Mone Forests Landscape is located in Western Cameroon and constitutes a transitional zone of rainforest and forest savannah. This study assessed large mammals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 diversity with focus on the Cross river gorilla and anthropogenic activities in the Lebialem-Mone Forest Landscape, Cameroon. A total of 36 transects of 4x4 km grid were surveyed. Relative density was estimated for mammal signs and human activities using DISTANCE. All data on large mammals were lumped together and encounter rates for each transect estimated for the determination of biodiversity hot spots. Spatial distribution maps were produced using geo-referenced relative densities that were imported into Arcview 3.2 for shape files production and finally into ArcGIS 9.2. This study documents the abundance and distribution of 7 species of large mammals including 2 great apes; Pan troglodytes elliotti and Gorilla gorilla diehli. The overall Relative Density of large mammals in the forest landscape was estimated to be 0.64 signs per km with high potential for great apes. The highest mean encounter rates for human activities in the study area were recorded for hunting. The findings of this survey indicate that the forest landscape lodges a fragile and important population of great apes and large mammals. The levels of hunting and agricultural activities eventually increase the pressure on the wildlife populations and the landscape.",

        "description": "This study compared the accuracy of the Beta, 2-parameter Gamma (2P) and 3-parameter Weibull (3P) distributions, fitted with the method of moments, for characterising the tree diameter of the reserve. Comparison was based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (K-S), bias, mean absolute error (MAE), and mean square error (MSE). Distributions with location parameter were fixed as the minimum inventoried diameter of each plot. A total of eight (8) temporary sample plots (TSPs) of size 50m x 50m were laid in the natural stand of the reserve. Systematic line transect was used in the laying of the plots. All trees with DBH \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 10.0cm in the selected plots were enumerated, identified and measured. The results from the goodness-of-fit statistics revealed that the Weibull (3P) distribution performed slightly better than the Beta distribution used in this study. The mean values for the K-S, bias, MAE, and MSE of the Weibull distribution were 0.11449, 0.00015, 0.00847, and 0.00022, respectively; as such ranked best. The Gamma (2P) distribution provided the worst fit to the dataset, with relatively large values for the goodness-of-fit statistics. It fits for the entire plot were far from the reverse J-shaped of natural forests, which implies that the Gamma (2P) distribution is inappropriate for determining the structure of the natural stand.\r\nKeywords: diameter characterisation, probability distribution, moments, natural forest\r\n",

Most tropical forest fruit trees have the problem of long gestation; hence modern farmers are not ready to wait for a long period of time, therefore low investment attraction. A trial on the grafting and budding of G.kola was successfully carried out in Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria (FRIN), Ibadan, Nigeria using the Modified Cleft Grafting (MCG) and chip budding. The level of success was higher in grafting (85%) and low in budding (25%). Data were recorded and analysed for height, number of leaves and collar diameter of seedlings for twelve weeks. There was no significant difference in height between the two methods of propagation viz., grafting and budding. The process of grafting and budding are discussed. With this low level technological input of grafting and budding, the potential for conservation of G. kola and its attraction in Agroforestry system could be enhanced.</p>",

        "description": "Aims: To evaluate plant diversity and to show the structural variation of the vegetation in a cocoa agroforest of various ages.  \r\n\r\nStudy Design: Slash and burn agriculture is one of the processes of deforestation and degradation of forests. Cocoa agrosystems that consist to plant cocoa for commercialisation by farmers are also the  measures  of  attenuation  and  adaptation  to  climate  changes.  It  is  important  to  harvest  the catalogue of species that can be found in a cocoa agrosystem. \r\n\r\nPlace and Duration: Pendiki subdivision from 10 September 2013 to 20 January 2014. \r\n\r\nMethodology:  Three  types  of  cocoa  were  selected;  young,  adult  and  old  cocoa  agroforests. Sampling was done along plots of 625 m2 (25 x 25 m2). A total of 36 plots were realized with 12 plots for each category of cocoa agroforest. Each plot was subdivided into sub-plots of 5 x 5 m2. Floristic inventory concerned herbs, shrubs and trees with DBH superior or equal to 3.2 cm. A total surface of 2.25 ha was investigated. \r\n\r\nResults: A total of 414 species including 109 timbers and 306 herbs and divided into 256 genera and  87  families  were  harvested.  Young  cocoa  agroforests  were  more  diversified  than  old  cocoa plantations.  Some  big  trees  were  scattered  in  the  cocoa  agroforests  (Ceiba  pentandra,  Albizia zygia, Canarium  schweinfurthii). Some species of the IUCN red data list were found in the study site (Afzelia bipindensis, Entandophragma cylindricum, Nesogordonia papaverifera). \r\n\r\nConclusion: Although the conservation of biodiversity in the cocoa agroforests of Pendiki is not a priority for the cocoa farmers, the agricultural practices favour the preservation of biodiversity. Such agricultural  practices  could  be  considered  as  an  attenuation  measure  to  climate  changes;  the evaluation of the stock of carbon in such agrosystem is being carried out. ",

        "description": "Abstract\r\nClimate change is associated with changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. This is accelerated by the degradation and loss of forests through anthropogenic activities, leading to carbon (C) emissions thus raising atmospheric C levels and temperature. Mangroves sequester 14% of C in the oceans despite occupying less than 0.5% of the coastal ocean.With global deforestation contributing more than 20% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, continued mangrove degradation is likely to significantly elevate the concentration of GHG in the atmosphere and aggravate global warming with its attendant consequences. In the present study, we report the storage of C and emissions from degraded mangroves in two heavily impacted peri\u00e2\u20ac\u201curban creeks namely Tudor creek and Mwache creek of Kenya. In Tudor creek the mangroves neighbors an ever\u00e2\u20ac\u201cincreasing informal settlement, subjecting mangroves to anthropogenic pressure mainly overexploitation for fuel\u00e2\u20ac\u201cwood, building materials and as a waste disposal site. Mwache creek mangroves experienced a massive dieback following flooding and vast sedimentation from the Indian Ocean Dipole in 1997/98 and 2006. In the Island, species, which could not withstand long periods of submergence, were also greatly affected with some dying during the flooding period. Transects perpendicular to the shore, were identified prior to field work using Google earth images based on vegetation density and stand structure laid in preselected highly degraded and less degraded sections of the mangroves. Stratified random sampling based on vegetation density for three C pools (above ground, below ground and soils) was used to collect data. The total ecosystem carbon stock was estimated at 101.64\u00c2\u00b157.3C t.ha-1 and 246.14\u00c2\u00b147.2 t.ha-1 in Tudor and Mwache creeks respectively. There were significant differences in ecosystem C (p=0.0013) between highly degraded and less degraded sites within the creeks. There was 71.38 t.ha-1yr-1 and 91.32 t.ha-1yr-1 of carbon lost translating to 261.96 t.ha-1yr-1 and 335.13 t.ha-1yr-1 CO2 equivalents emissions for Mwache and Tudor respectively. The rate of C loss calls for pertinent management strategies like formulating a management plan, awareness creation, energizing community efforts in reforestation among others to curb degradation hence reduced emissions.\r\n",

        "title": "FUEL WOOD CONSUMPTION IN ABEOKUTA  METROPOLIS,  OGUN STATE ",
        "description": "<p>In most developing countries of the world, fuelwood is the major and the cheapest source of energy, especially in rural communities and urban centers. The aim of this study is to access the fuelwood utilization pattern and consumption rate in Abeokuta metropolis. The study is carried out with the administration of well structured questionnaires to randomly selected respondents and the results obtained are subjected to descriptive analysis. The result obtained shows that nearly every respondent makes use of fuelwood for one purpose or the other. Majority of the fuel wood that is utilized are basically obtained by purchase and self-collection from vacant plot and open lands within the city. The findings also shows that the sales of fuel wood is a very lucrative and growing business within Abeokuta metropolis probably due to the increasing rate of fuel wood demand for households and small scale businesses. Moreover, the attitude of people towards fuel wood production is not encouraging and this can be a threat to urban biodiversity. The study was carried out in Abeokuta Ogun State Capital.</p>",

        "description": "<p>An information system was developed for forest reserves in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Primary data were collected from the field, which comprise stand growth data, geographic coordinates of selected locations within forest reserves, and information on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in the natural forest. Photographs of the forest reserves were taken as part of the primary data. Growth data were taken from both plantations and natural forests. From the plantations, stands of Gmelina arborea, Tectona grandis and Terminalia superba were inventoried. Four temporary sample plots were randomly selected for enumeration from each age series of each stand. For the natural forest, two transects 500 m apart were laid parallel to each other. Along each transect, four 50m by 50m temporary sample plots were laid adjacent each other at 200m intervals. From each sample plot, growth data were taken as well. Secondary data were also collected, which involved the list of all forest reserves in the State, size, date gazetted, revenue generation records and management practice. Sketched maps of all the forest reserves and satellite imageries of the State were also collected as part of the secondary data obtained. The coordinates and photographs were loaded into ArcView GIS 3.2a for geographical information analysis, which involves vectorization of the raster data model, map production and image processing. Yield estimates of the trees were obtained using Newton&rsquo;s formula. All the analyzed primary and secondary data were used to generate a database in Microsoft SQL server 2008. The database created by Microsoft SQL server 2008 formed the data access of the software developed using C# Programming Language. The software was developed in an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) using visual studio 2010 Edition. The database generated was user-friendly, adequate and has provision for regular updates.

Satellite imageries and sketch map of Eda Forest Reserve were obtained from google earth and Ekiti State Department of Forestry respectively to produce a base map. Coordinates of some places within the forest reserve that could easily be identified both on the map and directly on the ground were also obtained using hand held global positioning system (GPS) receiver (Garmin GPS 76). Photographs of the forest reserve were taken for the purpose of hotlinking. The coordinates, satellite imageries, sketch maps and photographs obtained were loaded into Quatum GIS for analysis. The satellite imageries and sketch map were georeferenced using the coordinates obtained from the forest reserve. Map of the forest reserve was generated showing the various land use (natural forest, Terminalia superba, Gmelina arborea and Tectona grandis plantations) within the forest ecosystem, which involves vectorization of the raster data model, map production and image processing. Various forest types were represented with polygons of different colours and sizes, road was represented with line. The photographs obtained were used to hotlink various sections of the forest to the digital map produced. It was observed that the natural forest in Eda Forest Reserve occupied the larger portion of the reserve and it accounted for 57.7% of the total land cover while plantations of Gmelina arborea, Tectona grandis and Terminalia superba accounted for 15.5% of the total land cover of the forest reserve.

        "description": "Distribution of various Colleges of Education in Nigeria was examined. The list of Colleges of Education in the country was obtained from National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE) and their respective coordinates were obtained. Satellite imagery of Ikere forest reserve was obtained from Google earth while the sketch map was obtained from Ekiti State Department of Forestry (ESDF). Photographs of some parts of the forest reserve were taken. A set of 50 questionnaire was administered by the old staff of the College of Education, Ikere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ekiti.  The coordinates of various Colleges of Education obtained were loaded into ArcGIS to represent their locations on the map of Nigeria. Federal Colleges were represented with points, state colleges were represented with asterisks while private colleges were represented with upward arrows. All the attribute data obtained for Ikere forest reserve were used to generate a digital map showing the extent of all the various land use within the forest ecosystem. Various forest types\r\nwere represented with polygons of different shapes and colours. Roads of different types were represented with lines of different sizes. Photographs of some parts of the forest reserves were hotlinked to reveal the actual status on the land. Administered questionnaire was coded and analyzed appropriately.\r\nIt was discovered that the Colleges of Education established by the State Government were more (56.63%) than those established by the Federal Government (26.51%) while the private ownership established the least Colleges of Education (16.87%) in the country. When the spatial\r\ndistribution of Colleges of Education by geopolitical zones were examined, South West recorded the highest number (21.69%), followed by North East (20.48%), South South (15.66%), North Central (14.46%), in that order and the least was recorded in South East (13.25%). Forest in its\r\nnatural status in Ikere forest reserve have been reduced to mere farmland, degraded land and encroached plantation of Gmelina arborea and Tectona grandis, which was not the case before the inception of the College. Old staff of College of Education Ikere Ekiti was responsible for the level of depletion of the forest reserve\r\n",

All in all, 10 attributes have been identified: the flavor, color, consistency, taste, local and natural character, nutritional value, geographical origin, viscosity and texture. The descriptive analysis shows its taste (60%) as being the main attribute of Agonlin oil, followed by its flavor (51%). The majority of interviewees consume Agonlin oil many times in a week (59%). But the oil is consumed by people with low income (40000 to 75000 FCFA). Other consumers with average income agree to value Agonlin oil when it is well manufactured and conserved. This study shows that Agonlin oil is a traditional and original product that the consumers agree to value. Consequently, Agonlin oil rightly deserves a geographical indication protection.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In 2003 Madagascar committed to tripling its land in protected areas to conserve its unique biodiversity and essential ecosystem services. Implementing this commitment involved creating a new legal framework, selecting sites, establishing resource use rules, and developing governance arrangements. The Ankeniheny-Zahemana Corridor (CAZ) is among the most advanced in its establishment as a protected area with a co-management governance arrangement. Through literature review, we identified nine elements of good governance: clear resource governance goal, coherent institutional structure, clear rules, participation, transparency, monitoring, enforcement, equity, and transfer of authority. We analyzed the CAZ co-management system to explore the possibilities for improved governance at CAZ. Although the CAZ governance structure was not designed to address the nine theoretical elements of good governance, we found that it has emerged to respond to several of them. Additional research is needed to assess how to make changes that might improve governance based on these elements.</p>",

        "description": "Increased commercialization of the stem bark of Annickia chlorantha (Oliv.) Setten & Maas has resulted in an escalation of local harvesting of the plant, and concerns about the sustainability of wild extraction. Yet, there is a dearth of information on conservation status of the species within its range. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the stem bark harvesting of A. chlorantha and its conservation status in Omo Forest Reserve (OFR) and Shasha Forest Reserve (SFR), South-western Nigeria. Using a well structured questionnaire, data were collected from harvesters of the species through a snowball method. The conservation status was assessed through inventory from eighteen belt transects of equal size (10\u00c3\u2014500m) located in three different forest types namely; less disturbed natural forest, disturbed natural forest and plantation forest. Results showed that about 2,700.00kg annum 1 and 2,280kg annum 1 of the product is harvested from OFR and SFR for a value of N248,400 ($1,242) and N209,760 ($1,048.8) respectively. Mean densities in OFR ranged from 16.00/ha in recently disturbed natural forest to 19.33/ha in both the less disturbed natural forest and plantation area. In SFR, estimates ranged from 13.33/ha in plantation area to 17.33/ha in recently disturbed natural forest and 24.67/ha in less disturbed natural forest. Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences (P < 0.05) in the number and distribution of the species by forest types in the two reserves, while Friedman test showed no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the number and distribution of the species between the two. More stands of the species were represented in the 5.1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10.0cm diameter class, with stands exceeding the 15.1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 20.0cm class found only in SFR. These results suggest a regenerating species albeit at a low level, and with an indication of a senescing population. There is need for further research on sustainable harvesting methods and domestication programmes to address the crucial issues of sustainable exploitation of A. chlorantha in the country. ",

Data were obtained from a random sample of three categories of respondents; gatherers/harvesters, processors and marketers of Shea butter in the study area by means of structured questionnaire. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequency table and percentages for clarity purpose. Results from the analysis revealed that women were more actively involved in the Shea business across all levels with 73.3% gatherers, 100% processors and 70.70% marketers/middlemen, this is probably because women are involved in the provision of food security and family welfare in most communities worldwide (Arabomen et al, 2009). Twenty-nine (96.67%) of the processors and all the gatherers had Vitellaria paradoxa stands on their farmland which served as a major source of V. paradoxa fruits from which the Shea is processed while others without tree stands collected the fruits from nearby forest lands. The result also showed the rate of collection of shea nut by harvesters. 10%, 10%, 20%, 23.33%, 6.67% and 16.67% gathered between 1, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 tons of shea nuts respectively while 13.33% gathered less than 1 ton per annum. The average per capital income generated by the different categories of respondents in the business showed that harvesters (6.67%) earned between 10,000 and 50,000, 23.33% earned above &gt;50,000, 26.67% earned above &gt;90,000 and 43.33% earned above &gt;130,000 as annual income for their families. This study has shown that small scale forest-based enterprises are fast becoming the main stay of scores of people who have suffered under ravaging scourge of unemployment especially in rural communities and it is been recognized as an important factor in poverty, inequality and malnutrition issues around the world.</p>",

Three (3) Local Government Areas were purposively selected for the study and purposive random sampling method was adopted for the selection of respondents. Primary data were obtained through the use of questionnaires while secondary data was gathered from relevant literature. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistical tools and gross margin analysis. The result showed that 90% of Vitellaria paradoxa and 94.3% of Parkia biglobosa processors were female. Majority of the processors of V. paradoxa (77.1%) and P. biglobosa (58%) fell within the age range of 21-40 years. Fruits of V. paradoxa (84.3%) and seeds of P. biglobosa (77.1%) were obtained from processors farmlands as a result of the relative availability of the trees on their farmlands. The remaining processors of V. paradoxa (15.7%) and P. biglobosa (22.9%) had no trees on their farmlands so they gathered the fruits and seeds from and around forest lands. 84.37% of V. paradoxa and 88.5% of P. biglobosa processors indicated that income was the main economic benefit derived from this business while social benefits highlighted by the respondents ranged from produce been used as food, medicine, condiment and cosmetic. The result also showed that processors of V. paradoxa incurred more costs, produced more output and had a higher average gross return in processing than P. biglobosa processors. The RORI for the processing business in the study area was 51% and 96%. To promote sustainability the people have adopted local means of sustaining production by preventing indiscriminate livestock grazing and bush burning.</p>",

        "title": "Deposits in wood microstructures of some wood species",
        "description": "Implications of wood deposits in processing and utilization of wood species of Terminalia superba, Daniella ogea, Distemonanthus benthamianus, Afromesia elata, Mansonia altissima, Tectona grandis, Gmelina arborea, Afzelia Africana, Pterocarpus soyauxii, Guara cedrata, Holoptelea grandis Khaya ivorensi, and Gossweilerodendron bassalmiferun were investigated in this study. Wood deposits such as resins, gum, crystals, silica, tannins and oils are usually deposited in the wood microstructures (e.g, parenchyma cells) thereby making it impossible for end users to assign wood for certain uses. When in abundance the deposits could pose a great threat during wood processing such as causing dulling effect on saws, difficulty in preservative absorption, inability to bond with other adhesives during board and laminated items production, and staining thereby reducing the aesthetic value of the wood. Some wood species not suitable for cement-bounded were found to be blocked with some deposits such as gum deposits. However, some deposits  (tannins, resins and  oils) identified in some wood species have made such woods useful in some industries such as leather industry making them of industrial importance and are found useful when abundantly present wood; some wood deposits also confer beauty and also protect wood against bio-deteriorating agents such as termites and beetles. This study revealed the reason why some of the wood species investigated were found unsuitable in some areas of utilization, and why some are desirable for certain end uses owing to the presence of deposits in wood microstructures; photomicrographs showing the positions in wood are also presented. \r\nKeywords: vessels, parenchyma cells, deposits, utilization and suitability.\r\n",

        "description": "The incidence of sorghum diseases in Dawakin-Kudu local government Area of Kano state was surveyed\r\nin the 2009 agriculture year. The area is found at Sudan savanna agro-ecological zone of Nigeria. Sorghum diseases\r\nwere surveyed at seedling and grain filling stages. The survey was carried out from July to October during which three\r\nfarmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fields were surveyed at every location on a road/foot path network. Total number of 60 farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fields in 20\r\nlocations was surveyed. An average incidence (%) of the disease was obtained from a sample of 150 plants selected\r\nusing simple random sampling technique from each of the three fields visited per stop. Results indicated the presence\r\nof 16 different types of sorghum diseases in the area; ten foliar diseases and 6 panicle diseases. Out of the ten leaf\r\ndiseases, 8 were fungal and consist of grey leaf spot, sooty stripe, leaf blight, anthracnose, downy mildew, rough leaf\r\nspot, zonate leaf spot, and oval leaf spot and two bacterial leaf diseases which includes; leaf stripe and leaf streak. The\r\npanicle diseases observed during the survey included grain mold, covered smut, head smut, long smut, loose smut and\r\nergot disease. Of these panicle diseases, head smut appeared to be having the highest incidence and was found in all the\r\n20 locations surveyed hence, the most prevalent. No viral diseased symptom was observed during the survey. It\r\nappeared therefore that sorghum diseases are prevalent in the region. There is therefore the need to enlighten the\r\nfarmers on the possible farming practices that will help control the diseases before they become destructive.\r\n",

        "description": "There is inadequate information on the population characteristics of the endangered Mandrillus leucophaeus in Nigeria. Thus, a study on the population status of the species was conducted in Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary, Southern Nigeria. Data were collected from twelve randomly located transects each from the Northern and Southern Blocks of the area using Distance sampling technique. Each transect was walked 8 times (making a total of 192 km survey efforts) only during the day. Sighting and perpendicular distances were obtained using laser rangefinder. Data were analyzed using DISTANCE 6.0 to compute\r\ndensity, encounter rate and abundance with the Akaike information criterion as the model selection criterion. The student tstatistics was used to compare the sighting distances between the two management blocks. The result showed that there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in mean sighting distances between the two blocks. A total of 210 individuals were sighted in the area. About 56% (118) of the sightings were recorded in the Northern Block while 44% (92) were in the Southern Block. The mean encounter rates were 0.95 km-2 and 0.77 km-2 for the Northern and Southern Blocks respectively, and the estimated densities were 7 km-2 and 6 km-2 for the Northern and Southern Blocks with species abundance of 367 and 300 individuals respectively. The estimated species abundance in the entire area was 669 individuals with MER and density of 0.95 km-2 and 6\r\nkm-2 respectively. Protection efforts should be stepped up to ensure adequate protection of drills in the area, as there were signs of encroachment with evidence of hunting exemplified by spent cartridges.",

        "description": "The study investigated stem distributions and height-diameter relationships of two Irvingiaceae species in Oban Forest, Cross River State, Nigeria with a view to suggesting appropriate management strategies for their conservation in the area. Using systematic sampling technique, six 2km-transect was cut in each of the primary and secondary forests in the area. Four 50m\u00c3\u201450m plots were laid alternately along each transect. Thus, twenty-four plots were used in each of the two forest types, making a total of 48 sample plots for the study. On each of the sample plots, Irvingia wombulu and Klainedoxa gabonensis were identified and their growth parameters measured on the trees with DBH\u00e2\u2030\u00a510cm. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The result reveals that there were average of 3 and 4 I. wombulu and K. gabonensis stems/ha respectively in the area. About 47% of I. wombulu fell in the height class 10-20m, about 36% of K. gabonensis fell in the height class 21-30m. Both species have fewer stems in the height class of >40m. Tree diameter distributions reveal that about 33% of I. wombulu were in the class 10-39cm. Only 16% of K. gabonensis belong to this class. About 20% of K. gabonensis encountered fell in the diameter class \u00e2\u2030\u00a5100cm. There were significant differences between most of the tree growth parameters for the two species. However, the species were found to exhibit similar growth patterns in the two forest types. All the height-diameter models presented in the study were significant. In all I. wombulu gave better models than the K. gabonensis, going by their modelling efficiencies and tests of bias. The models were therefore recommended for predictions in the study area.",

        "description": "This study assessed the status of Ohaji/Egbema watershed, using systematic sampling technique. Three 300 m-long transects were laid at 100 m intervals. Six 0.25 ha-plots were alternately laid at 50 m intervals along each transect. Trees with Dbh\u00e2\u2030\u00a55cm were measured and identified. The soil samples were collected from the randomly selected locations at 0 - 15 cm, air-dried, sieved with a 2 mm sieve, tagged and analyzed, following standard laboratory procedures. The water samples were collected from Oloshi River, bounding the area, at the upper, middle and lower river courses and analyzed. Data generated were subjected to computation of Simpson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index, relative density, basal area, Margalef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s index, relative dominance. Analysis of variance was conducted for soil physicochemical and water-quality parameters at the different locations. Ten tree species belonging to 10 genera and 8 families were identified. Nauclea diderrichii was the most abundant in the area with a relative density (RD), diversity index (DI), BA/ha and relative dominance (RDo) of 0.310, 0.0954, 0.298 m2 and 26.87 respectively. Pentachlethra macrophylla was the least common having RD, DI, BA/ha and RDo of 0.043, 0.0000, 0.0041 m2 and 0.37 respectively. There were no significant differences in mean sand (%), silt (%), clay (%) and moisture content (%) of the upper, middle and lower parts of the forest. However, the mean bulk densities significantly differed between the middle and the lower parts (p<0.05). Nevertheless, the means in the upper and lower parts were not significantly different. The highest mean bulk density of 1.700\u00c2\u00b10.080 g/cm3 was recorded at the middle part of the forest with the least mean bulk density of 1.500\u00c2\u00b10.121 g/cm3 at the lower part. The mean soil porosities significantly (p<0.05) differed between middle and the lower parts of the forest with means 36.23\u00c2\u00b13.300 and 43.770\u00c2\u00b14.550 respectively. Nevertheless, the mean porosities did not significantly differ between the upper and the middle parts. There were no significant differences in mean soil pH, Ca, Mg, Na, H, TEB, TEA, ECEC and %BS of the different forest parts. However, there were significant variations in mean organic carbon, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and K in the upper, middle and lower parts (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in mean Ca, Mg, pH, alkalinity, hardiness, CO\u00e2\u201a\u201a, DO and temperature in different river courses. However, significant variations existed in mean electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, Mn, Fe, Zn and Cd. No Fe was detected at the middle and upper river courses (0<0.05). Zn was highest at the middle river course and least at the upper course.",

        "title": "PATTERNS OF FIREWOOD EXPLOITATION AND UTILIZATION IN PERIURBAN AND RURAL AREAS OF OWERRI ZONE IN SOUTHERN NIGERIA",
        "description": "A study was conducted to assess the firewood extraction and utilization patterns in two local government areas of Owerri zone, Imo State, Nigeria. Purposive sampling technique was adopted for sites selection based on the prominence and prevalence of firewood extraction and utilization in the areas. Five communities each were chosen from the two local government areas. Both primary and secondary data collections were made. The primary data collection involved the use of a well-structured questionnaire, and the secondary data were obtained from National Bureau of Statistics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Annual Abstract of Statistics. The third part of data collection involved the measurement of the amount of firewood collected by individual using a weighing balance. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and t-test of significance. The result indicated that majority of the firewood exploiters were women, who are above forty years of age. The major sources of firewood in the area remain\r\nnatural forests with only a fraction exploited from the farm/fallow lands. There was no established fuel-wood plantation in the area, and plan to establish such appears non-existent. The species mostly extracted are Acioa barteri, Alconia cordifolia,\r\nAnthonatha macrophylum, Dialium guinense, Harungana madagascariensis, Macaranga barterii, Milicia excelsa and Pentaclethra macrophylla, with preference for Acioa barteri, Dialium guinense and Pentaclethra macrophylla due to their low moisture contents and ability to burn faster and efficiently. Firewood was exploited in both farming and off-farming seasons at varied degrees with most exploitation done in the off-farming season. Firewood was found to be more expensive during farming season. The most expensive species are Dialium guinense, Macaranga barterii and Pentaclethra macrophylla, which are sold for N18.18 each during the farming season, and N13.64 kg-1, N15.21 kg-1 and N15.21 kg-1 respectively in the offfarming season. The result revealed that the average per capita firewood consumptions were 1.83\u00c2\u00b11.62 kg day-1 and 2.15\u00c2\u00b10.94 kg day-1 in Owerri North and West Local Government Areas respectively. The study shows that the patterns of\r\nexploitation and utilization in the area are not sustainable. It is therefore recommended that a strategy be put in place to ensure adequate replenishment to avoid over-exploitation, deforestation and environmental degradation.",

        "title": "CROWN RATIO MODELS FOR TROPICAL RAINFORESTS SPECIES IN OBAN DIVISION OF THE CROSS RIVER NATIONAL PARK, NIGERIA",
        "description": "Crown ratio (CR) is a characteristic used to describe the crown size, which is an important element of forest growth and yield. It is often used as an important predictor variable for tree-level growth equations. It indicates tree vigour and is an important habitat variable. It is often estimated using allometry. Modified versions of Logistics, Richards, Weibull and Exponential functions were used to predict CR for tree species in the Oban Division of the Cross River National Park. Systematic sampling technique was adopted in the three study sites (Aking; Ekang and Old-Netim) for plot locations. Two transects of 2km long with a distance of 600m apart were cut in each of the study sites. Four sample plots of 50m\u00c3\u201450m were then laid alternately along each transect at 500m intervals. This procedure was repeated in the close-canopy and secondary forests in the three study sites. Forty-eight sample plots were used for the study. Tree variables (Dbh; diameter at the middle and merchantable top; crown diameter; total height; merchantable height; stem quality and crown length were measured on all the trees with Dbh>10cm. The canopy layer to which each tree belongs was noted. All the measured trees were identified. The Weibull and Exponential functions gave consistent and accurate results in almost all the canopy layers in the two forest types with R2; SEE values of 0.72; 0.068 and 0.72; 0.067 respectively for the dominant canopy, 0.75; 0.075 and 0.75; 0.074 respectively for the co-dominant canopy. Exponential function produced the best fit models in the study except under intermediate canopy layer, where it was not found suitable for crown ratio predictions. However, the difference in results produced by the two functions is negligible. They are therefore recommended for crown ratio prediction studies in Oban Division of the Cross River National.",

The samples were analyzed for their proximate and phytochemistry at the School of Agriculture and Agricultural Technology (SAAT) Laboratory of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria. The results revealed that honey samples from I. gabonensis have the best overall acceptability rating in terms of fat content (2.97%), vitamin C content (259.26%) and protein content (2.97%). Honey samples from T. africana have the best overall acceptability rating in terms of moisture contents and vitamin A contents (17.27% and 1.53% respectively). Honey samples from Trifoliate citrus also had the best overall acceptability rating in terms ash and sugar contents (1.15% and 7.20% respectively). For phytochemicals, honey samples from P. macrophylla had the best overall acceptability rating in terms of flavonoid and alkaloid contents (21.30% and 15.26% respectively), while samples from T. africana had the best overall acceptability rating for tannin content (0.17%). Furthermore, samples from I. gabonensis have the best overall rating for phenol content (18.75%), while samples from T. citrus had highest hydrogen cyanide content value (279.00%). The honey samples were however within the limits of international standards with respect to suitability for human consumption.",

        "description": "We evaluated the contribution of African walnuts, Plukenetia conophora to sustainable livelihood in Imo State. A multi-stage sampling technique was adopted for the study. Imo state was divided into three agro-ecological zones namely; Okigwe, Orlu and Owerri zones. In each of the zones, three Local Government Areas (LGAs) were purposively selected based on the prevalence and utilization of the African walnuts in those locations. Three communities each were then randomly selected in each of the LGAs. A total of two hundred and seventy (270) respondents (i.e. 90 from each LGA) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Information on income generated from sales of African walnut, the roles of gender in the harvesting and sales as well as consumption of the species were gathered. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and analysis of variance was used in comparing significant differences in mean price/nut, income generated and daily profit made from the sales of the nuts in different LGAs. The result revealed that majority of walnut actors were females (57%), while 43% were males. Most of the respondents had no formal education, only about 16.6% of the respondents had primary education. There were 19.3% of the respondents with secondary education with only 6.7% having tertiary education. About 96% of the respondents in the area were Christians with only 1.1% being Muslims. There were 2.6% traditional worshipers. The mean household size in the study area was 4.0 \u00c2\u00b1 2.0. Majority (62.2%) of the respondents were farmers, while about 24% were civil servants and 13.3% of them were traders. The walnuts consumed in the area came from four different sources including purchase (27%), natural forest (2%), plantation (68%) and home garden (1.9%). The study also showed that over 96% of the respondents consume walnut mainly for its nutritional and medicinal values. Highest mean monthly income generation of \u00e2\u201a\u00a6 54,900 \u00c2\u00b1 18,256 was recorded in Ideato North LGA. The lowest mean income generation (\u00e2\u201a\u00a6 31,033 \u00c2\u00b111,598) from the sales of the product was in Ihite Uboma LGA. The highest profit was realized from the sales of walnut by those in Owerri West LGA. Most of the walnut consumed in the study locations was collected from either the plantation as well as natural forests.",

        "description": "Many tropical forests are under great anthropogenic pressure and require management intervention to maintain the overall biodiversity, productivity and sustainability. This cannot be possible without proper understanding of their structure and species diversities. Tree diversity in Oban Division of the CRNP was assessed. Systematic sampling technique was adopted for plot locations. Two transects, 2km long with a distance of 600m apart were cut in each of the three study sites. Four plots of 50m\u00c3\u201450m were laid alternately along each transect at 500m intervals in the closed canopy and secondary forests. Forty-eight plots were used for the study. Tree growth parameters were measured on all the trees with Dbh>10cm within each plot. All the measured trees were identified and classified into their respective families. Species diversity indices were computed for the trees in the two forest types. The canopy layer to which each tree belongs was noted. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Diversity Indices, t-test as well as analysis of variance. A total of 118 species (107 genera and 37 families) of trees were recorded, with 72 and 69 species in the closed canopy and secondary forests respectively. The Strombosia spp. was the most abundant species in the forests. The family, Olacaceae accounted for 11.94% of the total individuals recorded in the area. This was followed by Mimosoideae (8.4%). The average tree stems/ha was 158 and 130 in the closed canopy and secondary forest respectively. The Simpson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Indices were 0.99 and 0.98 for the two forest types respectively, which implied high floristic richness. The Shannon-Wiener\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Indices (4.36 and 4.14) and the equitability ratios (0.9513 and 0.9506) were high for the two forest types, which indicated moderate representation of most of the species in the area. The tree growth parameters significantly differ under different canopy layers (P<0.05). However, most of the parameters were not significantly different in the two forest types (P>0.05).",

        "title": "The Role of Traditional Laws and Taboos in Wildlife Conservation in the Oban Hill Sector of Cross River National Park (CRNP), Nigeria",
        "description": "Efforts to integrate rural people into biodiversity conservation through community-based conservation programs is an old tradition. These efforts were largely based on economic incentives, with little or no attention given to the role of culture and traditions in building support for conservation. Although these strategies are useful in promoting conservation and local empowerment, they are still fragile. Scholars suggest that incorporation of traditional values which reflect locally important cultural practices of the people into the management of conservation areas in Africa will help in their successful conservation. There is a strong need to assess cultural practices; traditional laws and taboos of the people in protected areas, and how they have assisted conservation in the past. To understand how such practices could be strengthened and incorporated into natural resources management\r\nand conservation strategies, there is a need to have a general overview of existing practices. The study analyzes the ways in which cultural practices and value systems of the people of Oban Sector of Cross River National Park Nigeria, have aided conservation in the past and how such practices can be encouraged, strengthened and replicated for sustainable natural resources management in the study area and possibly proposed for adoption elsewhere. Ten cultural institutions and seven laws and taboos which regulate the use of resources were recorded in the area. These laws and taboos were respected by all indigenes. Eleven animal species were found to be forbidden by the people. Some of the tabooed animals were for spiritual reasons while some were for medicinal purposes. Every community had sacred forests, called Mgbe forest (Eten Mgbe) The social organizations in the area ensured that these taboos are obeyed. Presence of other tribes, new religions/westernization, use of modern hunting equipments and poverty pose a threat to the effectiveness of these taboos as a conservation tool. Adaptation of some aspects of these taboos may be valuable for wildlife conservation, particularly in protected areas.",

        "description": "Across West and Central Africa, duikers are important for trade and consumption; their populations are expected to become depleted. Reliable data on their status are scanty in\r\nNigeria. We assessed duiker populations in the Oban Sector of Cross River National Park through diurnal and nocturnal surveys along 32 transects of 2 km each. After 508-km survey effort, only Ogilby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duiker (Cephalophus ogilbyi) and blue duiker (Philantomba monticola) were recorded. Using habitat as a covariate in modelling detection probability in DISTANCE 6.0, we estimated densities for the blue duiker ranging from 15.5 (95% CI:\r\n7.8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30.9) in the core, 5.8 (CI: 2.6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12.9) in the buffer and 0.9 (CI: 0.09\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10.1) km\u00c2\u00b2 in farm fallow to no duikers in the plantation. For Ogilby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duiker, densities ranged from 1.6 (95% CI: 0.7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3.7) km\u00c2\u00b2 in the core, 2.0 (CI: 0.8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5.1) in buffer to no duikers in farm fallow and plantation. The apparent absence of yellow-backed and Bay duikers may indicate local depletion.

        "description": "Sustainable forest management requires accurate measurements of tree growth variables. Foresters and ecologists have long observed regularities in tree growing processes, where every aspect has its own role. These aspects are inter-linked and are usually explained by allometric equations. Allometric relationships for estimating tree-level parameters are important for managing forest resources. This study establishes height-diameter and stem volume allometries for Coula edulis (Baillon), Strombosia grandifolia (Hook.f. ex Benth) and Strombosia postulata (Oliv.) of Olacaceae family in Oban Hill region of the Cross River National Park. Systematic sampling technique was adopted for plot locations. Fortyeight 50m~50m plots were used. In all the plots, tree growth variables were measured for the three species with dbh.10.00cm. The data were analyzed using descriptive  statistics, ANOVA and regression. The result showed that Strombosia postulata was the most abundant of the three members in the stand (42.8% of the total). Height-diameter equations produced poor results for the three species with R2-values of between 0.20 and 0.50. The stem volume equations were rather good. For the quadratic models, Strombosia grandifolia produced the best result (R2 = 0.97; SEE = 0.21) while  Strombosia postulata produced the best result for the transformed models (R2 = 0.98; SEE = 0.13).",

Five stands of Tectona grandis selected for this study were located at University of Ibadan Second Gate (UISG), International School Ibadan (ISI), Agodi garden (AG), Oke Baba-agba (OKBA) and Obegimo (OBGM). Twenty seven temporary sample plots of size 25m\u00c3\u201425m were proportionally allocated to the five stands with respect to their land areas; and the sample plots were randomly located within each stand. Ten plots in UISG, 2 plots in ISI, 5 plots each, in AG, OKBA and OBGM respectively. Measurement of tree growth variables (diameters at breast height, base, middle and top, crown diameter and length, total height, merchantable height and stem quality) of all the trees in each of the plots in the study area were taken. Ages of the five stands were noted. For the purpose of sight quality estimation, seven largest trees were chosen from each of the plots as the dominant trees per plots. The measured variables were processed and used to compute basal areas and stem volume of trees at individual tree and whole-stand levels. The dominant height-age data set were used to construct site index equation. This was used to estimate site index values for each of the plots. In addition, volume computed from all the trees within each sample plot was used to construct yield models at individual tree and whole-stand levels.

The results showed that contamination of soil with crude oil significantly reduced (P 0.05) the performance of Jatropha curcas seedlings as regards plant height, number of leaves, leaf area and collar diameter when compared with seedlings grown in the uncontaminated soils. The performance of the seedlings was oil concentration dependent. Other symptoms observed at the higher levels of oil treatments were yellowness of leaves, leaf fall/drop, chlorosis, growth retardation and stagnation as well as wilting. This study has shown that crude oil in soil has a highly significant effect of reducing the performance of J. curcas seedlings. The oil level most tolerated by the plant is 2.0% w/w and above this level, significant reductions were recorded. This study has great implications on the sustainability of this multipurpose species, which has been identified as a potential biofuel species.",

        "description": "Marketing of forest products such as sawn-wood plays an important role in determining the prices received by the forestry sector and those paid by the forest stakeholders. Forest product marketing system in Nigeria appears to be inefficient and poorly integrated. The study examined market integration of sawn-wood of Poga oleosa in Delta State of Nigeria with a view to evaluating the performance of the markets. The study investigated the trend in prices of selected dimensions {2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u20142\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u201416 (0.013m3) 2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u20143\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u201416 (0.019m3) and 2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u20144\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u201416 (0.025m3)} of P. oleosa sawn-wood in Delta State, Nigeria. Secondary data on monthly retail prices of the Poga oleosa and dimensions spanning 2004 to 2013 were sourced from sale records of sawnwood sellers in the urban and rural markets of the state. The data were analyzed using Ravallion model, Augmented Dicker Fuller (ADF) test, Engle-Granger Co-integration test and Error Correction Mechanisms. The maximum and minimum prices\r\nfor P. oleosa in urban market were \u00e2\u201a\u00a6320, \u00e2\u201a\u00a6435, \u00e2\u201a\u00a6610 and \u00e2\u201a\u00a6135, \u00e2\u201a\u00a6225, \u00e2\u201a\u00a6330 while prices in the rural market were \u00e2\u201a\u00a6350, \u00e2\u201a\u00a6465, \u00e2\u201a\u00a6570 and \u00e2\u201a\u00a6140, \u00e2\u201a\u00a6240, \u00e2\u201a\u00a6330 respectively. Sawn-wood prices for all dimensions considered were all integrated of order one I (1). The Index of Market Concentration (IMC) indicates that the markets exhibit high short-run market integration for 2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u20142\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u201416 (0.013m3) and 2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u20144\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u201416 (0.025m3) while 2\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u20143\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00c3\u201416 (0.019m3) exhibited low short-run market integration. The urban and rural markets were co-integrated in the long-run and the error correction model result indicated that there is high degree of price transmission. This shows that there is high efficiency of price information flow in sawn-wood markets in Delta State. We recommends that forest stakeholders should be provided with more price information to stimulate their interest in forestry investment, which will lead to sustainable forestry development in Delta State since the sawn-wood market is performing efficiently.",

This species is at risk of disappearing, as it has very low germination percentage (2% and less), which negatively affect the reforestation efforts of the tree. The low germination percentage might be due to inhibitors produced by the fruit itself. In this study different parts of the fruit were tested to reveal which part of the fruit inhibit the germination and affect the seedlings performance. Two fruit extractions with two concentrations (100fruit/ litre and 200fruit/litre) from the fruit pulp and fruit wings were used to irrigate seeds of A.mellifera. The result showed that the high concentration (200 fruit/litre) of both wings and bulb extracts significantly reduced the germination percentage. Although, the root and shoot lengths were not affected, the appearance of the first leaf was delayed. The fruit wings extraction caused abnormal growth of the seedling. Therefore, it can be that the two tested parts of the fruit may contain inhibitors that decrease the germination percentage of this species",

This study was carried to investigate the seed color polymorphism of Acacia mellifera in relation to germination percentage .The result showed that the percentage of the brown greenish seeds almost about half of the bulk, the brown and green almost share the same percentage. The viability of the three colors almost had the same percentage, which means that the color of the seeds was not associated with seed viability further studies were need for demonstrating if this polymorphism associated with seedling performance or with seed storability.",

        "description": "<p>Allanblackia parviflora A. Chev., an underutilized fruit tree species commonly found in tropical rainforest of West Africa, has potential for integration into agroforestry systems for economic and environmental benefits. The seed oil of A. parviflora is considered economically important but wild fruits collection produces an average of 40 tons of oil annually. However, over 100,000 tons of Allanblackia seed oil is needed annually by food and cosmetics industries. The need to domesticate and conserve A. parviflora to ensure adequate sustainable supply of seed oil and to sustainably manage the genetic resources is therefore critical. This paper reviews the current state-of-the art on domestication and sustainable use efforts of Allanblackia. Propagation methods have been developed to encourage large scale commercial cultivation, include grafting, rooting of stem cuttings and research into improved seed germination. Range-wide germplasm collection has been undertaken leading to establishment of 140 accessions in a gene bank for future source of germplasm. Mother blocks, i.e. established plots consisting of grafts, seedlings and cuttings, have been established at Rural Resource Centres with 58 elite clones, which have been recommended for distribution to farmers. The diversification of cropping systems to include A. parviflora trees is projected to contribute to community livelihoods development and poverty reduction through large-scale production and supply chain development of the species. Furthermore, the integration of A. parviflora into agroforestry systems is important for the conservation of the genetic resources of the species.</p>",

        "title": "Tracing forest resource development in Ghana through forest transition pathways",
        "description": "Tropical deforestation is a serious environmental and economic problem that has become a global issue due to climate change and biodiversity loss. Reducing tropical deforestation is seen as national and international priority, given its impacts on carbon emissions, biodiversity and rural livelihoods. Some developing countries have achieved a forest transition: a shift from net deforestation to net reforestation, whereby a few generic pathways have been identified. Such pathways usually depend on the social, economic, ecological and political contexts of a country. A better understanding of trends related to the pathways at the country level is necessary to identify which factors drive forest transition. This paper analyzes forest resources development trends in Ghana by focusing on forest transition pathways and discussing the implications for a forest transition in the country. The analysis indicates that there is currently no strong force towards a forest transition through any of the generic pathways. Existing trends are either too small-scale or too ineffective. To accelerate a forest transition in Ghana, policy and management options should target measures that reduce current degradation of closed natural forests, increase the area and productivity of commercial forest plantations, promote sustainable forest management, and support and encourage forest conservation and integration of trees into farming systems.",

        "description": "Building on farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agroecological knowledge to design environmental-friendly agricultural systems is crucial given the environmental impact of industrial agriculture. We investigated the drivers of farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge of agrobiodiversity management and analyzed how farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge and their current farming contexts may guide future farming systems in sub-humid (Bassila) and semi-arid (Boukoumb\u00c3\u00a9) areas of Benin. We conducted structured interviews with 180 farmers and used generalized linear models and correlation analyses to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge and perception. Land tenure, ecological conditions and sociolinguistic membership were the main drivers of farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge of agroforestry systems, practices, species diversity and current farming systems. Sociolinguistic membership also significantly predicted farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge of livestock management. Farmers in the semi-arid area were more involved in integrated crop-tree-livestock systems than those in the sub-humid area. However, all farmers indicated a willingness to adopt this integrated farming system regardless of socioeconomic and ecological factors. Farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge of agrobiodiversity (crops, agroforestry species and livestock diversity) management was correlated with the involvement in integrated crop-livestock-tree and agroforestry systems. These findings provide insights into how farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 knowledge can serve as basis in optimizing agricultural and livelihoods systems. Investigating the ecological, economic and social performance of the most desired integration/diversification options using a system approach involving a co-innovation process can further our mechanistic understanding of farmers decision making process.

        "description": "<p><a href=\"http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/10/1/80\">Agrobiodiversity is said to contribute to the sustainability of agricultural systems and food security. However, how this is achieved especially in smallholder farming systems in arid and semi-arid areas is rarely documented. In this study, we explored two contrasting regions in Benin to investigate how agroecological and socioeconomic contexts shape the diversity and utilization of edible plants in these regions. Data were collected through focus group discussions in 12 villages with four in Bassila (semi-arid Sudano-Guinean region) and eight in Boukoumb&eacute; (arid Sudanian region). Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 180 farmers (90 in each region). Species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index were estimated based on presence-absence data obtained from the focus group discussions using species accumulation curves. Our results indicated that 115 species belonging to 48 families and 92 genera were used to address food security. Overall, wild species represent 61% of edible plants collected (60% in the semi-arid area and 54% in the arid area). About 25% of wild edible plants were under domestication. Edible species richness and diversity in the semi-arid area were significantly higher than in the arid area. However, farmers in the arid area have developed advanced resource-conserving practices compared to their counterparts in the semi-arid area where slash-and-burn cultivation is still ongoing, resulting in natural resources degradation and loss of biodiversity. There is no significant difference between the two areas for cultivated species richness. The interplay of socio-cultural attributes and agroecological conditions explains the diversity of food plants selected by communities. We conclude that if food security has to be addressed, the production and consumption policies must be re-oriented toward the recognition of the place of wild edible plants. For this to happen we suggest a number of policy and strategic decisions as well as research and development actions such as a thorough documentation of wild edible plants and their contribution to household diet, promotion of the &lsquo;&rsquo;bringing into cultivation&rdquo; practices, strengthening of livestock-crop integration.</a></p>",

        "description": "The aim of this study was to determine the changes in forest carbon in three village forests in Tanzania during 2009-2012 using participatory forest carbon assessment, and to valuate the capability of the local communities to undertake the assessment, and the costs involved.\r\nThe results show that forest degradation is caused not only by disturbance as a result of anthropogenic activities; other causes include natural mortality of small trees as a result of canopy closure, and the attraction of wild animals to closed-canopy forests. Thus, mechanisms are required to compensate communities for carbon loss that is beyond their control. However, an increase in the abundance of elephants Loxodonta africana and other fauna should not be considered negatively by local communities and other stakeholders, and the importance of improved biodiversity in the context of carbon stocks should be emphasized by those promoting REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). This case study also shows that the cost per ha of USD <1 for participatory\r\nforest carbon assessment is less than that reported for Tanzania and elsewhere (USD 3-5); this is attributed to the large area of forest studied. However, the cost of data analysis and reporting in 2012 (USD 4,519) was significantly higher than the baseline cost (USD 1,793) established in 2009 because of the involvement of external experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "Forestry research and education in Nigeria has come a long way from the establishment of the first organized training of Silvicultural Assistants and later Forest Assistants initially at Zaria in 1939 and later at Ibadan and Yaba, Lagos from 1941 and 1942 respectively, although, this was preceded by organized forestry practice reported to have commenced in the country in 1886 with the appointment of an officer to take charge of the forests of the Colony and Protectorate of Lagos under Sir Alfred Moloney, the then Governor. Series of early research efforts were carried out through botanical expeditions by European scientists focusing on species composition, structure, regeneration and distribution of the Nigerian rainforests. By 1954, the Federal Department of Forest Research (now Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria, FRIN) was established followed by the Department of Forestry (now Department of Forest Resources Management) University of Ibadan, the first professional forestry school in West African Sub-region, in 1963 while Savannah Forestry Research Station, Samaru was established in 1964 both by the FAO/UNDP. Presently, at the university level, more than twenty offers partial or full forestry degree programmes apart from polytechnics, colleges and vocational forestry training in different part of the country with more still springing up. Irrespective of the proliferation of forestry training departments in many academic institutions in the country, the main objective of producing qualitative manpower that can provide the leadership to meet the challenges, stimulate sustainable development and provide solutions to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and by extension Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problems is still yet to be realized if compared to the past when the few trained Nigeria forestry graduates ranked among the best in the Commonwealth. Various reasons had been attributed to this among which are poor funding, loss of incentives, bureaucratic bottlenecks, brain drain, outdated research, teaching and learning curricula and facilities, among others. The situation in most of other sub-Sahara African countries is not significantly different. Suggestions are offered for the improvement of forestry research and education in order to contribute to sustainable development in Africa.",

        "description": "Synthetic preservatives for wood and fibre are increasingly receiving criticisms owing to their negative impacts on the environment and life forms. This has therefore encouraged studies that are aimed at applying preservative properties of substances from organic sources. This study, that is one of such, was carried out to investigate the efficacy of neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) seed oil-treatment for bamboo (Bambusa vulgaris Schrad. ex J.C. Wendl.) against a fungus, also a basidiomycete, known as Pycnoporus sanguineus (L. ex Fr.) Murr. The experiment was conducted using oven-dried longitudinally-splitted bamboo samples conditioned to 11.76% mean moisture content and converted to test specimens for percentage weight loss (PWL) and treated with mechanically extracted crude neem seed oil (NSO) at two different treatment temperature regimes by completely soaking a set in NSO at ambient room temperature of 25 \u00c2\u00b1 2oC for 24 hours and soaking the other in NSO at 60oC for 4 hours with untreated samples serving as control. The oil-treated and control samples were initially weighed and subsequently inoculated with cultured P. sanguineus and monitored in an incubating room maintained at ambient temperature of 25 \u00c2\u00b1 2oC and 65 \u00c2\u00b1 5% relative humidity for 12 weeks (84 days). After the 84 days incubation period, the test specimens were then reweighed and the PWL determined. Results showed that mean values for PWL was highest for those obtained for control samples (18.21%), comparatively lower for samples soaked in NSO at 25 \u00c2\u00b1 2oC for 24 hours (5.88%) and lowest for samples soaked in NSO at 60oC for 4 hours (2.21%). Implications of these values were discussed with conclusions and recommendations based on the outcome of the study.",

        "description": "Wood deterioration was recently observed in some standing trees of Gmelina arborea Roxb. in the arboretum of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife, University of Uyo, Uyo, Nigeria. In contributing to efforts at finding solutions to this challenge, microbes in deteriorated wood and arboretum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soil were isolated and cultured using Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, Potato Dextrose Agar and Nutrient Agar, in line with standard procedures. These procedures were also adopted, using the three culture media, in isolating and culturing microbes from non-deteriorated wood and soil samples obtained 200m away from the arboretum. The pure isolates of the microbes were identified using cultural, microscopic and other characteristics. The identified purely isolated microbes in deteriorated wood samples were Aspergillus niger, Rhinotrichum spp., Phymatotrichum spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Streptococcus pyogenes while there were no identifiable microbes in non-deteriorated wood samples. In addition, soil from the arboretum had the following microbes; Aspergillus niger, Rhinotrichum spp., Phymatotrichum spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus while those in soil samples obtained 200m away from the arboretum were Aspergillus niger, Actinomyces spp., Streptomyces spp., Geotrichum spp., and Oedocephalum spp. In conclusion, the results obtained from this study showed that the main source of microbial attack on wood tissues in standing G. arborea in this arboretum appeared to be the soil.",

        "description": "Environmental pollution is assuming frightening dimensions in many parts of the world. This is not excluding Niger-Delta region of Nigeria where most of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil and gas are sourced with attendant production of noxious substances as by-products/residues/waste. Many of these noxious substances have been noted to be removable from polluted environment through proper application of phytoremediation techniques, particularly using native plant species. Consequently, this research was conceived to evaluate potentials for phytomediation by native red mangrove tree (Rhizophora racemosa G.F.W. Meyer). This was carried out by evaluating the presence of heavy metals ions and their bio-concentration levels in the samples of root and wood tissues axially along the stem of this tree. The surrounding soil and water were also sampled and evaluated for presence and concentration of these metal ions in comparison with those for the sampled plant tissues. All the samples were sourced from a mangrove forest in Okrika, Rivers State, Nigeria. The samples from the root, butt, 50% and 90% bole length were oven-dried at 60\u00c2\u00b15oC to constant weight, pulverised and heated with trioxonitrate (v) acid to achieve total dissolution before subjecting them to atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Similarly, samples from sorrouding soil were dried at 35\u00c2\u00b12oC to constant weight, crushed and sieved using a \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 2mm mesh before performing metal extraction and detection using AAS while water samples were also subjected to AAS for heavy metal analyses, in line with appropriate standard methods. The data obtained were statistically analysed using basic descriptive tools, Analyses of Variance and Fishers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Least Significant Difference (P < 0.05). Outcomes of these statistical analyses showed that, in terms of bio-concentration values, the evaluated metal ions that include Fe, Cu, Mn, Cd, Pb, Ni and Cr were more in the root than the surrounding soil and water. The bio-concentration trends, for the metal ions, also progressively declined from the root towards the crown of the trees. The bio-concentration distribution in all the tree sections showed an inconsistent pattern with Fe ions having higher bio-concentration. In addition, Cr, Ni, Pd and Cu also inconsistently followed Fe in terms of bio-concentration level.",

        "description": "The various stages of petroleum industrial activities are linked with at least a by-product, residue or waste. One of such is an effluent from the mining of crude oil and gas, known as produced water, which contains varying quantities of hydrocarbons and heavy metals, thereby making it to require proper treatment in order to reduce the contaminants load to acceptable levels before being discharged into the environment. However, there are reports that this by-product is sometimes discharged untreated into Nigeria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coastal waters. This study was therefore carried out in order to contribute to efforts at sensitising the various stakeholders concerning this challenge. In carrying out this study, samples of untreated produced water were obtained from a crude oil production platform in Rivers State, Nigeria, using chemically clean amber glass bottles, properly covered with Teflon-lined lids to prevent contamination, transferred to the laboratory in ice boxes, and subjected to atomic absorption spectroscopy for heavy metals detection and quantification in line with standard laboratory procedures. Results showed that the following detected heavy metal ions i.e., Iron, Copper, Manganese, Cadmium, Lead, Nickel and Chromium had mean concentrations, in mglitre-1, of 3.9, 2.5, 2.4, 2.7, 1.4, 2.6 and 1.2 respectively. These values were comparatively higher than the documented required limit for these metals in drinking water and effluent to be discharged into inland water. The prescribed limits for drinking water by World Health Organization (mglitre-1) are as follows: Fe (2.0), Cu (2.0), Mn (0.4), Cd (0.003), Pb (0.01), Ni (0.07) and Cr (0.05).",

Split-bamboo specimens from the same source with same dimension were oven-dried at 103 \u00c2\u00b1 2oC, conditioned to 11.76% mean moisture content, and treated by completely soaking a set in oil at an ambient room temperature of 25 \u00c2\u00b1 2oC for 24 hours (A) and by soaking the other in hot oil at 60oC for 4 hours (B). Results obtained showed that test specimens for A and B had mean OA values of 57.02 \u00c2\u00b1 3.23 and 124.30 \u00c2\u00b1 7.26 kgm-3 respectively. Regression model developed for predicting OA from TT and DOT had a coefficient of determination of 0.93 with a significant ANOVA result (p < 0.05). Implications of the results obtained were discussed while conclusions and recommendations were made in line with the outcome of the study.",

        "title": "Selected Physical and Chemical Properties of Mechanically Extracted Neem Seed Oil Sourced as a Preservative for Ligno-Cellulose in Southwestern Nigeria",
        "description": "Most of the seeds produced by neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss) trees in Nigeria are currently underutilized. Hence, relevant literature provides only limited information concerning many of the seed oils from this country, especially where it con\u00c2\u00accerns the potential applications of these oils as preservatives for ligno-cellulose against bio-deterioration. Using standard procedures therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate and document selected physical and chemical properties of neem seed oil (NSO), mechanically extracted using a cold press at 31.03 N\u00e2\u02c6\u2122mm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192 pressure and a room temperature of 25 \u00c2\u00b1 2\u00c2\u00b0C. The results show that oil yield was 38.42% with a specific gravity of 0.91 \u00c2\u00b1 0.01. The amount of acid was 18.24 \u00c2\u00b1 1.31 mg KOH\u00e2\u02c6\u2122g\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 and that of iodine 93.12 \u00c2\u00b1 2.01 g\u00e2\u02c6\u2122100 g\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, while saponification and peroxide values were 172.88 \u00c2\u00b1 2.06 and 1.42 \u00c2\u00b1 0.04 mg\u00e2\u02c6\u2122g\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 respectively. The implication of the values obtained, particularly those for the chemical properties, as they concern the potential application of NSO as a preservative for ligno-cellulose, is likely that it may be useful in this regard since the values may support some of the documented anti-microbial properties of the oil, although other physical and chemical properties that may affect this potential are recommended for investiga\u00c2\u00actions. Conclusions and other recommendations follow in line with the results of the study.",

Woody species found in agroforestry plots/farms in the study area, were compiled from questionnaires retrieved from 179 respondents, then prioritised using the respondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ranking, from which twelve species that top the ranking were selected. Friedman chi-square result revealed that there was no statistically significant difference in the ranking pattern of the respondents in the two LGAs (\u00cf\u20212=2.17; p<0.05). The questionnaire survey and literature search for other traditional uses to which the various parts of the accepted fuelwood species are put revealed that culinary and medicinal uses were dominant among these other uses. It was therefore recommended, based on this study, that management strategies that aim at balancing wood use as fuel and other traditional uses should be encouraged.",

        "description": "This paper intends to contribute to the efforts aimed at achieving sustainable environmentally benign methods of treating and preserving lignocellulosic materials. For this study, split bamboo samples, with mean specific gravity of 0.89 and conditioned in the laboratory to 11.76% moisture content were treated, at two different temperature regimes, with mechanically extracted neem seed oil. Selected mechanical properties for the oil-treated and untreated bamboo samples were determined in conformity with modified ASTM D 143-83. Results showed that mean values for moduli of rupture and elasticity (MOR and MOE) for static bending strength test were lowest in samples soaked in hot oil at 60\u00c2\u00baC for 4 hours but higher in samples soaked in oil at room temperature of 25\u00c2\u00b12\u00c2\u00baC for 24 hours, with control samples possessing higher values than those for the oil-treated samples. One way analysis of variance also revealed statistical significant variation in the data obtained for MOR and MOE at 5% significance level. Fishers Least Significant Difference was used as a follow-up test to compare means, also at 5% significance level.",

        "description": "Wood usage for cooking and heating is still very relevant in most developing countries especially those of sub-Saharan Africa and many parts of Asia. Therefore, sustainable means of generating it for this and other purposes are necessary bearing in mind the influence of indigenous knowledge/users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective on any production method regarding success and sustenance. In conformity with this view, questionnaires were administered on 240 respondents in 8 rural communities of Akinyele and Ido Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Oyo State, Nigeria, to elicit information on species that can be used as fuelwood, preferred by the respondents for incorporation into and/or retention in agroforestry plots, out of which 179 (i.e. 75% of the total number of questionnaires administered) were successfully retrieved for statistical analyses. Twelve woody species namely: Annona senegalensis, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Bridelia ferruginea, Daniellia oliveri, Detarium microcarpum, Gardenia ternifolia, Hymenocardia acida, Lophira lanceolata, Parkia biglobosa, Terminalia avicennioides, Triplochiton scleroxylon and Vitellaria paradoxa were prioritized on the basis of respondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preference using a ranking pattern. Friedman chi-square analysis showed that there was no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the ranking pattern of the respondents from the two LGAs. The mean net calorific values (NCV) of the 12 species were found to be 17.71, 18.63, 18.04, 16.03, 17.67, 18.46, 19.00, 21.68, 19.63, 18.25, 14.65, and 19.47 MJkg-1 respectively. The result of a two-way analysis of variance indicated a significant variation (p < 0.05) in NCV data for all the species pooled together but not for each species except for D. oliveri with a follow-up test using Fisher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Least Significant Difference. The Pearson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moment correlation analysis gave positive coefficient values (r = 0.868 and 0.874, p < 0.05) between NCV and the cumulative ranking values in Akinyele and Ido LGAs respectively. There was also a coefficient value of 0.873 (p < 0.05) between the cumulative ranking values in the two LGAs. In line with the outcome of this study, it was therefore recommended that native intelligence/indigenous knowledge and/or users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective should be part of the criteria for selecting potential fuelwood species for incorporation into and/or retention in agroforestry systems in this and other areas with similar characteristics.",

        "description": "Biofuel is presently still central to survival and sustenance of livelihoods in many parts of sub-Sahara African region. Demand for woodfuel in the form of firewood and charcoal is continuously increasing in this region, and it is therefore necessary to devise and sustain feasible production methods bearing in mind the influence of native intelligence, indigenous/traditional knowledge and/or users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspectives on their success. In line with this, a survey was carried out by administering questionnaire to 240 respondents in 8 rural communities of Akinyele and Ido Local Government Areas of Oyo State, Nigeria, where the predominant type of agroforestry system practiced is that of scattered trees in croplands, to elicit information on wood species used as fuelwood and preferred by the respondents for incorporation into or retention in most agroforestry plots, out of which 179 (i.e. 75% of the total number of questionnaires administered) were successfully retrieved for statistical analyses. Twelve woody species were selected on the basis of respondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preference and prioritization. The mean specific gravity (SG) and net calorific values (NCV) of the species were found to range between 0.42-0.84 g\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2cm-3 and 14.65-21.88 MJkg-1 respectively. The linear regression equation developed predicting cumulative numerical values (CNV) attached to each ranking position indicating respondents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 preference using SG and NCV together as predictors gave a coefficient of determination (R2) of 77.1% with an ANOVA result showing a significant relationship between CNV and SG. Predicting CNV using only SG as a predictor gave R2 of 75.7% while that for using NCV alone as a predictor gave R2 of 67.7% with ANOVA showing significant relationship between CNV and each predictor for both equations, respectively. Based on the outcome of the study, it was recommended that users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perspective, native intelligence and indigenous/traditional knowledge should be part of the criteria for selecting potential fuelwood species for incorporation into or retention in agroforestry systems in this study area and others with similar characteristics.",

        "description": "<p>The problem of environmental pollution has assumed an unprecedented proportion in many parts of the world especially in Nigeria and its Niger-Delta region in particular. This region is bedeviled with this problem perhaps owing to interplay of demographic and socio-economic forces coupled with the various activities that revolve round the exploration for and exploitation of large deposit of crude oil discovered there. Many methods and processes of preventing, removing and or correcting the negative effects of pollutants released into the environments exist but their application in this country for this purpose has either been poorly implemented or not at all, a situation that is worsening owing probably to claims of lack of virile regulatory bodies and overwhelming dependence of government on crude oil for income. Studies have shown that the livelihood of local inhabitants largely depend on renewable natural resources which is environment dependent, thus, it is imperative that the environment should be sustainably managed in order to continue serving this function through comparatively cheaper means, one of which phytoremediation is. The objective of this review is to discuss phytoremediation studies using in-situ techniques and their potentials as a remediation technique that utilizes the age long inherent abilities of living plants to remove pollutants from the environment but which is yet to become a commercially available technology in many parts of the world including Nigeria.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Abstract: The purpose of this research was to identify the type of human- wildlife conflicts and wild mammals that cause the conflict, determine the extent of damage and to provide a better understanding of the causes of human-wildlife conflict in Wondo Genet district. The study was carried out from December 2013 to June 2013. Four sample areas were selected to collect data on human-wildlife conflict; Gotu, Wosha Soyoma and Wethera Kechema villages and Wondo Genet College of Forestry and Natural Resources. Data were collected using questionnaires, one to one interviews, observations and cross checking of crop loss using quadrants in selected crop lands, reviewing of literature, and was later analyzed using statistical package for social scientists (SPSS). In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the target population comprised the households living in sampled areas, local administrators and staffs who lived within Wondo Genet College of Forestry and Natural Resources. The study established that crop damages, livestock killing, human disruption and property destruction were some of the mostly reported damages. The results of the study further indicated that animal species most involved in HWC were warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), bush pig (Potamochoerus larvatus), vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), Olive baboon (Papio anubis), porcupine (Hystrix cristata), Giant mole rat (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus) and African civet (Civettictis civetta). They were involved mostly in crop raiding/ damage. Most raided crops were maize (Zea mays), sugar cane (Saccharum africanum) and Enset (Ensete ventricosum). Over 75% of the population of Wondo Genet district was affected by crop raiders. Therefore, conservation education is paramount, coherent land use plans should be emphasized to determine where certain crops can be grown.</p>",

        "description": "Abstract: Textile industries contribute immensely to surface water deterioration and are categorized among the most polluting in all industrial sectors. For this reason, the heavy metals profiles of Hawassa Textile effluent along with Tikur Wuha River and their accumulation in milk samples collected from cows watered in this water source was assessed in Chafe and Dato Villages, Southern Ethiopia. In the present study, water samples were collected from the textile factory treatment ponds and Tikur Wuha River at different sampling site. Similarly, fresh milk samples were collected from 15 cows watered in textile treatment pond water and Tikur Wuha River, Chafe and 15 cows from Dato, relatively far from textile industry. Metal levels in both water and milk samples were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer after wet digestion. The result shows the mean concentrations in water samples collected from site S1, S2, S3 and S4 to be 0.72, 0.652, 0.121 and 0.12mg/L respectively for lead metal, 0.135, 0.05, 0.124 and 0.132mg/L for nickel, 0.023, 0.01, 0.014 and 0.02mg/L for cadmium. The results further indicated that the mean concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cd and Cr in milk samples collected from Chafe were 0.8, 1.6, 0.2 and 0.2mg/L respectively while in samples from Dato village to be 0.4, 1.4, 0.1 and 0.8mg/L in the same order. It was therefore implicated that textile effluent entering Tikur Wuha River could cause toxic effects on consumers through food chain like via milk consumption and decreases livestock productivity consuming this water source and grazed around this area. It could also cause toxic effects on aquatic species of the river. It was emphasized that using the water for irrigation and water source for livestock in its present state is unsafe.",

        "description": "The influence of three pre-treatment methods on the hydration characteristics of Portland cement in combination with three tropical hardwood species was investigated. The maximum hydration temperature and time to reach maximum hydration temperature were analysed for the wood-cement-water mixtures of the three species after removing inhibitory extractives of wood samples by extraction with 5% Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), cold and hot water after removing inhibitory extractives of wood samples. There were differences in the hydration reaction of the wood species with Portland cement using the different pre-treatment methods.The compatibility of the wood species with Portland cement improved following pre-treatment. Sodium hydroxide pre-treatment had the most significant effect followed by hot water. Terminalia ivorensis (Idigbo), and Antiaris africana (Oriro) species showed considerable improvement in their compatibility with Portland cement at 5% Sodium hydroxide pre-treatment with maximum hydration temperature of 65 o C where Arere had 60.5 o C where both cold and hot water were unable to raise the hydration temperature beyond 55.5 o C . This study shows that the wood species requires more than cold and hot water extraction to make them suitable for wood cement composite materials as extraction with sodium hydroxide (1% solution) was found to be the most effective treatment for the wood species under investigation.

        "description": "In order to promote mulberry tree cultivation in Rwanda, a study on the evaluation of performance of mulberry tree varieties (Kanva 1, Kanva 2, and Thailand) planted in 2007, has been carried out in pedo-climatic conditions of Nyandungu marshland managed by Icyerekezo Cooperative in Ndera Sector of Gasabo District in Kigali City. The present study was specifically aiming at assessing different growth parameters of mulberry trees varieties, the amount of leaves biomass produced by the three varieties as well as their resistance to leafy diseases leading to leaf spots.  \r\nThe experimental design used was Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD) with three treatments corresponding to the three mulberry trees varieties (Kanva 1, Kanva 2, and Thailand) replicated six times.  One way ANOVA was carried out for the growth characteristics observed namely  plant height, diameter at collar, number of shoots, number of leaves whereas the yield parameters observed are the leaf length, leaf diameter and weight of leaves at harvest, three months after  the first cutting (88days). The disease severity (leaf spots) were assessed based on the percentage of leaves with symptoms using the five scale developed by Penrose(2004).  \r\nThe results obtained in this study revealed that Kanva 2 has the best performant considering both growth and yield parameters observed. In regard to growth characteristics, kanva2 comes first for height with 2.3 m on average and the largest diameter at collar of 0.6 cm while kanva1 is has the highest sprouting capacity with 11.5 of shoots as well as the highest number of leaves equal to 28.1. In addition Kanva2 is the one with longest leaf length (25.4 cm) and leaf diameter (21.4 cm) hence much leaves biomass with 6.48 tha-1of leaves weight at harvest followed by kanva1 and Thailand at the last position with 4.12 t ha-1 annually.).In regard to leaf spots, Kanva2 is the most resistant with the least score of leaf spots severity(1.3mark) followed by Thailand and kanva1 with 3.67 and 4.67 marks respectively. Thus, since leaves are key element in sericulture product, Kanva2 should be paid a special attention as fast growing variety, hence interesting in biomass production and diseases resistant. Nonetheless, there is a need to carry out a study on spacing, coppicing capacity; nutrients content and leaves palatability for silky worms and crop.",

        "description": "Abstract\r\nThe main objective of this study was to compare the growth performance of Alnus acuminata planted as intercrops in agroforestry systems and in woodlots by carrying out an inventory on trees planted in Nyabihu District, Rwanda in the year 2007. The height, Diameter at breast height (DBH), silvicultural treatments subjected to the trees and the stocking parameters including the number of trees, basal area, volume per hectare and mean annual increment (MAI) of height were compared. Farms and farmers to be sampled were randomly selected and a questionnaire was administered to compare the silvicultural treatments used on both land use systems. For measurements, 0.04 ha circular plots were used. T-Test were used to find if the performance means were significantly different between agroforestry systems and woodlots at P<0.05. For silvicultural treatments, pruning emerged to be the most practiced technique with all the farmers who have planted the species as an intercrop practicing; while 81.6% of the farmers prune their trees in woodlots. Coppicing is also practiced in both systems with (33.3%) and 16.6% using the treatment in intercropping and woodlot systems respectively. Thinning is done only in the case of woodlots while pollarding is practiced solely in the intercropping system. A higher DBH mean of 18.77cm was found in intercrops, while woodlots presented a lower mean of 17.3 cm. On the other hand, trees in the woodlots had attained a higher height with an average of 19.55m while the trees in intercrops had an average height of 13.23m. A higher number of trees per hectare (679 trees/ha) was found in the woodlots with a basal area of about 15.98 m2/ha and a volume was 153.00 m3/ha. The number of trees found in intercrops was 454 trees/ha with a basal area of 12.68 m2/ha and a volume of 84.14 m3/ha. The Mean annual increments (MAI) in intercrops and woodlots were 2.64 and 3.91 respectively. It can then be concluded that, there is a significant difference in the average number of trees per hectare, DBH, height and volume per hectare and silvicultural treatments between Alnus acuminata planted as intercrops and in woodlots. However, there is no significant difference in the average of the mean basal area per hectare between Alnus acuminata planted as intercrops and in woodlots. This study recommends that a national forest inventory be carried out to assess the performance of Alnus acuminata in different land use system and also advise farmers on the system that can be more profitable to them.",

        "description": "<p>Equity in distribution of income from forest products among producers, processors and traders is required for sustaining forests resource use. Despite many studies being undertaken on benefits of certified community forest products, distributional aspects of these benefits to the communities have not been fully examined. Employing a value chain analytical framework, this paper investigates the distribution of proceeds of forest products by assessing net revenue of roundwood equivalent and its shares among actors along the chain. A comparative study was conducted using the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified community forests and non-certified (non-FSC) forests in Kilwa District, Tanzania. Actors from certified forest communities were found to earn higher income than those from non- FSC forests, and experience significantly greater income equity. This finding suggests that forest certification is an important forest management approach in enhancing equity in income distribution among the actors. However, sustainability of equity in income for certified community forests in Kilwa is highly conditional upon the technical and managerial capacities of villagers, and their access to finance and markets of certified forest products. This study provides baseline data for future assessment of income distribution among actors for the various forest management regimes in Tanzania and the African region as a whole.</p>",

Properties, such as density, ash content and elemental composition were determined and related to the calorific value. It could be demonstrated that the wood with the highest calorific value does not necessarily constitute the best option as fuelwood, if environmental factors are taken into account.

        "description": "<p>The objectives of this study were to develop and assess a method of using tree ring measurements in standing pruned Pinus patula trees for modelling the knotty core of the pruned section of a tree and to assess variability in knotty core diameters in the tree stem. A total of 170 trees from 17 compartments on a wide variety of growth sites from the Mpumalanga escarpment in South Africa were selected and destructively sampled. We show that ring width measurements at breast height can be used to predict growth in the upper pruned section which in turn can be used to reconstruct the internal knotty core through the full pruned section of the log. Analysis of variation for the entire data set from ring width measurements showed that there was far greater variation in knotty core percentages (the percentage of diameter occupied by knotty core) between different compartments than within compartments. Within a tree, the knotty core percentages between three stem sections, 0.0&ndash;2.4 m, 2.4&ndash;4.8 m, and 4.8&ndash;7 m, differed significantly. As expected the knotty core percentages were found to increase from the bottom section (49.1%) to the top section (65.4%). A comparison of the actual measured knotty core size and the modeled knotty core size of a sub-sample of trees showed only a modest relationship (R2 = 0.62). Reasons for this might be variability in pruning quality, inaccurate pruning records, nodal swellings, and the methodology used to measure the actual knotty core sizes. Knowledge of knotty core sizes can be used as a decision aid in the forest and forest products industry.</p>",

While evidence of astrong relationship between tree growth and climate, par-ticularly water availability and temperature, has been foundin several studies, not much research has been done on howthe indigenous (hardwood) trees growing in the sub-regionhave adapted to changing climatic conditions. Trees areexpected to grow under more limiting conditions infuture\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe mean annual temperature is expected to rise,while the mean annual precipitation is forecasted to declineacross much of the region. The presence of growth rings insome tropical trees provides a means of understanding howgrowth and wood anatomy have been influenced by climatevariability and change over time and allows a prediction ofhow tree growth and wood quality will change with theexpected climate change in future",

The study focused on the Wari-Maro Forest Reserve and the &lsquo;Projet d&rsquo;Am&eacute;nagement des Massifs Forestiers&rsquo; five years after its completion. A forest inventory was carried out using 37 square plots of 729 m each to characterise the population structure of two types of plantations established: plantations with exotic species and plantations with native species. In addition, individual surveys were conducted with local households, organs of joint forest management and forestry officers to evaluate their perceptions about the participatory management of the plantations. Finally, the sustainability of the participatory management was assessed with an established rating system. Results showed that plantations with exotic species were more successful than plantations with native species. Local communities argued that they have not been involved in the plantations design but only in the implementation step and that their standards of living have decreased after the project completion. The rating system used showed that the participatory management of plantations had a short-term sustainability. The findings suggest that future projects should be designed and implemented with better participation of local communities as full partners.</p>",

        "title": "Agrarian change in tropical landscapes",
        "description": "Agricultural expansion has transformed and fragmented forest habitats at alarming\r\nrates across the world, but especially so in tropical landscapes. This has resulted in\r\nmosaics of land use encompassing varying levels of tree cover, human settlements and\r\nagricultural land units. Meanwhile, as a result of our expanding human population,\r\nglobal demands for agricultural commodities have never been as high as they are\r\ntoday. The imperative to feed 9 billion people by 2050 is causing further agricultural\r\nintensification and market-orientated production systems are now increasingly\r\nreplacing traditional farming practices, but at what cost?\r\nCIFOR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Agrarian Change Project uses an integrated landscape approach to explore\r\nthe livelihood and food security implications of land-use change and agrarian change\r\nprocesses in multi-functional landscapes in seven tropical countries. The content of this\r\nbook draws from experiences in field sites identified for the project: Cameroon, Burkina\r\nFaso, Ethiopia, Zambia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nicaragua. Each chapter gives a\r\ncomprehensive background to how tropical forest landscapes have undergone (and\r\nare still undergoing) considerable agrarian change as a result of global and local food\r\nsupply pressures. The chapters document the historical and political drivers of land-use\r\nchange in the focal landscapes, and outline the potential social, biological and economic\r\noutcomes for these areas.\r\nThis book also provides comprehensive contextual background to the wider empirical\r\nstudy that is ongoing in the focal landscapes. The main aim of the project is to examine\r\nsocioeconomic outcomes, and conservation, livelihood and food security implications\r\nof land-use change and agrarian change processes in multi-functional landscapes.\r\nThe research focuses on landscapes in multiple tropical countries, each exhibiting\r\nvarious combinations of agricultural modification, productivity, changing forest cover\r\nand integration with global commodity markets. Relationships between agricultural\r\nproduction and trade-offs/synergies with landscape components such as local food\r\nsecurity, dietary diversity and nutrition levels, market access, tenure, local poverty, and\r\nbiodiversity conservation are currently being investigated.\r\nThere is a distinct lack of information on the human impacts of agrarian change\r\nin forested areas, particularly with regards to socioeconomic effects of agricultural\r\nintensification, long-term dietary diversity and market integration processes. Previous\r\nresearch within the land sharing versus land sparing debate has focused heavily on\r\nthe trade-offs between food security (nominally production and yield metrics) and\r\nbiodiversity at a macro level, while local-scale effects upon livelihoods, poverty, food\r\nsecurity and nutrition have tended to be overlooked.\r\nThe case studies in this book highlight landscapes of varying scales, forest dependency\r\nand farming practices. Although the landscapes are very different in some respects\r\n(i.e. differing forest types, levels of biodiversity, agricultural practices and market\r\ninfluence), the main characteristic comparable across all seven landscapes is that\r\nthey exemplify clear gradients of agricultural expansion and intensification. Each is\r\ncharacterized by a continuum of land use from best available forest cover and high\r\ndependency on forest products with subsistence agriculture, to agroforestry systems\r\n(a mix of forest cover and crops), and monoculture/intensive cash cropping systems.\r\nFor example, this transition is demonstrated in Indonesia where a subsistence farming\r\nscenario (with high dependency of communities on forest products) transitions into\r\na rubber agroforestry and swidden agriculture system, which then transitions into a\r\ncommercial oil palm system. Similarly in Cameroon, the focal landscape exemplifies an\r\nagrarian transition from a cash cropping system, to cocoa agroforestry regimes, and to\r\na commercial oil palm system. In Ethiopia, subsistence agriculture transitions to a local\r\nmarket-orientated cash-cropping system and then to an extensive commercially-driven\r\nwheat arrangement.\r\nThe continuums of changing land use evident in each landscape collectively represent\r\na gradient of agrarian change across the tree cover transition. An agricultural\r\nmodification gradient often mirrors the forest transition curve, where it is anticipated\r\nthat as agricultural modification increases, forest cover and dependency on forest\r\nresources decreases. The land-use gradients in each focal landscape also often mimic\r\nhistorical land-use trajectories of the countries they are located in.\r\nEach of the seven case study chapters provides a comprehensive description of the\r\nphysical and socioeconomic context of the focal landscape chosen to conduct the wider\r\nAgrarian Change study, and a structured account of the historical and political drivers\r\nof land-use change occurring in the area. The chapters draw on information obtained\r\nfrom key informant interviews, focus group discussions and preliminary data collection\r\nregarding key topics of interest. These include: changes in forest cover and dependency\r\non forest products, farming practices, tenure institutions, conservation projects, and\r\nmajor economic activities. The case studies give first-hand insights into how and why\r\nland use has occurred in the focal regions, give a preliminary insight into the social,\r\neconomic and environmental effects of these changes, and provide comprehensive\r\nbackground information to the study areas should further research be conducted in\r\nthese regions in the future.",

        "description": "<p>Countries considering participating in a REDD+ mechanism need information on what it would cost them to reduce emissions fromdeforestation and forest degradation. This study was conducted to estimate the cost of managing forest carbon under REDD+ initiatives in Kolo Hills Forest, Kondoa, Tanzania. Socioeconomic and biophysical information was collected through structured questionnaires, focus group discussions, and forest inventory, respectively. Results show that the community participated in managing the forest by undertaking a range of activities such as tree planting, patrolling, and fire protection. The estimated total cost was USD 418,349.38 while the average cost was USD 79.06/ha. The average carbon stored was 19.75 tC ha-1, which is equivalent to 72.48 tCO2 ha-1. Costs incurred by managing the forest in relation to tCO2 stored were USD 1.0485 tCO2 e-1ha-1. The project was found to be economically feasible at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% discount rates withNPVs ofUSD107,102,331.83,USD33,986,255.86, USD 10,312,945, and USD 1,245,905.11, respectively. The internal rate of return was 21.21% which is much higher than the World Bank rate of 15.8% and the Tanzania rate of 14.8%. We therefore conclude that the decision to undertake this REDD+ project was worthwhile and should be favoured against the &quot;do nothing&quot; alternative.</p>",

        "title": "Using APSIM-model as a decision-support-tool for long-term integrated-nitrogen-management and maize productivity under semi -arid conditions in Kenya",
        "description": "There is continued decline in per capita agricultural productivity in the drier parts of Kenya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central highlands. The declines have been linked to low and declining soil fertility, soil water, high atmospheric heat, prolonged dry-spells and erratic rainfall. Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies have been developed and tested in the region. Despite their significant impacts, high variability in local soils and climate contributes to large variations and inconsistency in research results among replications. Experimentation is expensive and limited to a fewyears, sites and scenarios.Crop-growth simulationmodels suitably complement experimental research, to support decision making regarding soil fertility and water management. This study evaluated the performance of the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model. APSIM was parameterized and calibrated based on a rain-fed randomized complete block trial (2009\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2012) at a research station in Machang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a, Embu County. The study further reported on long-term effects of integrated Nitrogen (N) management from organic residues (goat manure, Lantana camara, Tithonia diversifolia and Mucuna pruriens) and their combination with mineral fertilizers in maize production. The model adequately reproduced the observed trends of maize leaf area index (LAI) and yield response to the testNamendments. Long-termsimulations showed that application of 0, 20 and 40Kg Nha30 \u00e2\u02c6\u20191 had low inter-seasonal variations (CV = 18\u00e2\u20ac\u201c33%) in yields. High yield variability (CV > 56%) was observed in the application of 60 and 80 Kg N ha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191. Application of 40 Kg N ha31 \u00e2\u02c6\u20191 by combining mineral fertilizer and manure showed 80% chance of harvesting more than 2.5 Mg ha32 \u00e2\u02c6\u20191 of maize grain yield. Maize stover mulching at 5 and 6 Mg ha33 \u00e2\u02c6\u20191 with the same N application increased long-term guaranteed grain harvests to 3.5 Mg ha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191. This is when complemented with 90 Kg P ha34 \u00e2\u02c6\u20191. This integrated N and soil water management is thus recommended. For subsistence farming, low-cost recommendations are\r\n36 geared towards some \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcguaranteed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 yield stability each cropping season. This recommendation underpins low-cost technologies that reduce production risks among small-holder farmers who faced with intermittent financial problems, to improve food security. However, there is need to evaluate and verify that there is a positive balance of primary nutrients such as N, P and K in such a fertility and water management option.  Its effects on C:N levels ought to be evaluated as well.",

        "description": "Abstract\r\nIntroduction: Forests form a major component of the carbon (C) reserves in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ecosystems. However, little is known on how management influences C stocks of woody vegetation, particularly in dry areas. We developed regression models for two dominant tree species to predict C stocks and quantified the potential of community managed forests as C sinks.\r\nMethods: Plots were randomly selected from community-managed natural forest, herbivore exclosures, and from communal grazing land. Tree and shrub biomass were estimated using a regression model on the most dominant woody species while herbaceous biomass was determined using destructive sampling.\r\nResults: The simplest model, based on only one single predictor variable, showed a good fit to the data for both\r\nspecies (Juniperus procera and Acacia abyssinica). Diameter at breast height (r2 > 0.95) was a more reliable predictor\r\nthan height (r2 > 0.54), crown diameter (r2 > 0.68) (p < 0.001). The C content of the total biomass for the managed natural forest and the exclosure were estimated as, 58.11 and 22.29 Mg ha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, respectively, while that for the grazing land was 7.76 Mg ha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, and the mean carbon content between the three land uses were significantly different (p < 0.05).\r\nConclusions: We conclude that forests managed by the community have a high potential for C sequestration and storage and their conservation should be promoted.

        "description": "Abstract\r\nIntroduction: Exclusion of grazing animals and tree plantations were among the methods used for the restoration of\r\ndegraded lands in tropical semiarid areas. Exclosures can foster secondary forest succession by improving soil conditions\r\nand modifying microclimate for understory growth. This paper compared the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spore\r\ndensity, root colonization of woody plants and soil chemical properties under exclosure with increasing age, and grazing\r\nland at different slope positions.\r\nMethods: The study was conducted in northern Ethiopia from 12 exclosure sites paired each with adjacent grazing land\r\nin total from 24 sites with four treatments replicated three times. In the entire study, 216 plots were examined of which\r\n108 were in exclosures and 108 in communal grazing lands. There were four age classes and three slope positions in\r\neach of the land uses. Composite soil and root samples were collected using nested plots measuring 100m2 from four\r\nsides of 1763 plants for spore enumeration and root colonization. Soils for chemical properties were collected from the\r\nfour corners and center of 5 m \u00c3\u2014 5 m plots.\r\nResults: All the 61 woody plant species that belong to 41 families were colonized by AMF. Spore density and\r\nroot colonization were significantly higher in exclosures as compared to grazing land and increased with increasing ages\r\nof exclosures. Foot slope had significantly higher spore density and root colonization than middle and upper slopes. Soil\r\nchemical properties were significantly higher in the exclosure, oldest age of exclosure, and foot slope position (except P).\r\nAMF spore density and root colonization were significantly positively correlated with soil chemical properties.\r\nConclusions: Exclosures are helpful to restore the AMF spore density and root colonization of woody species\r\nand soil fertility.",

We estimated woody plant\r\nbiomass at different Prosopis juliflora cover to quantify above- and below-ground carbon (C) stocks in\r\nAfar, northern Ethiopia. We developed allometric models to estimate aboveground biomass (agB)\r\nthrough destructive harvesting based on crown diameter (CrD), diameter at stump height (DSH), and tree\r\nheight (H) for twenty P. juliflora and 18 Acacia senegal trees. DSH showed the best model fit in predicting\r\nabove ground biomass compared to H, CrD, and the combination of those predictor parameters,\r\nrespectively. Models were highly significant for all agB components. Total C stocks of the entire woody\r\nspecies community were about 40% higher (86 Mg C ha\u00011) at high than at low (50 Mg C ha\u00011) P. juliflora\r\nencroachment categories. We conclude that allometric models using simple dendrometric parameters\r\nare highly valuable for assessing P. juliflora biomass. While in lightly invaded areas, eradication and\r\nprevention of further spread might be possible, we propose that the high C stocks of rangelands densely\r\ninvaded by P. juliflora, where eradication attempts have failed, should be considered for potential C trade\r\nmeasures.",

        "description": "Mau Forest Complex is the largest closed canopy montane forest in Eastern Africa harboring 12 river catchments. It consists of seven forest blocks all of which cover an extensive area of 416,456.373 hectares. In the last two decades, 107,000 hectares of the Mau Forest Complex was excised through human settlement (Et al; Government of Kenya 2004 raising concern by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) and other Non- Governmental Organizations. These concerns reached the Government that eventually yielded to pressure in year 2008 and through the office of the then Prime Minister, a 30-member Task force was put up to study and make recommendations to Government of Kenya on the immediate, short and longterm options for restoring the entire Mau Forests Complex. A new Forest Policy and law had been adopted earlier in 2005, placing significance emphasis on co-management of the Forest Resources with local communities and the private sector. This laid a foundation for strict control of logging and human settlements. The Task Force completed its work and submitted its report to the Government in March 2009.The Government of Kenya is committed to reversing the continued environmental degradation of the Mau Forest in line with its medium and long term National Development plans articulated in Vision 2030 blueprint Agenda of the Kenyan National Government.   This project uses Earth Observation techniques through remote sensing and Geographical Information Science to calculate the change in forest cover in the period 2008-2013. By October 2013, the analysis of this project shows that 42,065.1 hectares of the 93,104.91 ha excised in a period of four years, representing 45.18% of the target, had been reclaimed. This trend is commendable despite the challenges of evictees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 compensation. \r\n  ",

The machines compact soil and disturbe vegetation, the extraction of big wood causes erosion, reduced the specific diversity and decreases the capacity of regeneration of the forest. In order to find solutions reducing these impacts, this survey compares two system, the first one is classic and the other is reduced impact. The analysis of the impacts of those two operating systems was done on the basis of damage to tree planting, the valuable indigenous species and the soil surface damaged by tractors. The comparative analysis of the results of the Conventional Logging and Reduced Impact Logging showed that the daily performance of logs shaped is reduced by 11.34 % in Reduced Impact Logging compared to Conventional Logging. The volume of logs is reduced by 29.45 % in Reduced Impact Logging compared to Conventional Logging. The experiment showed that Reduced Impact Logging has resulted in a reduction of more than 55 % of total damage on woods compared to conventional logging. The area damaged by forest machines were 2266.7 m2 per hectare in conventional logging system and 631.5 m2 per hectare in the Reduced Impact Logging system, i.e., a reduction of more than 72 %.",

        "description": "Land use activities along River Nzoia Drainage Basin, Kenya, include cultivation along the river banks, overgrazing, deforestation, draining of wetlands for horticulture, harvesting of sand and brick-making. These activities have brought about changes in soil properties in the drainage basin adversely affecting farming output and the ecosystem in general. Consequently, it is important to understand how the different land use activities influence the soil properties in order to design and implement effective soil management strategies. This study examined the effects of land use practices on selected soil nutrients in Nzoia River Drainage Basin in Bungoma County. Cultivation and grazing were identified as important land use practices, while undisturbed sites were treated as controls. Land use practices along the river were identified by actual surveying of the study area. Secondary data on land use practices were obtained from technical reports, from local authorities and government offices. Soil samples were collected from different land use areas using randomly placed 5mx5m quadrats. Solis were collected at depths of 15cm in zigzag grid layout in each sample quadrat using soil auger. A total of 72 soil samples were collected in the study sites and analyzed for total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P) and organic carbon (C). Analysis of variance and correlation were performed to determine the significant land use practices affecting soil N, C and P. Cultivation had a significant effect on soil organic C mean value of 1.91 but negatively correlated with total Nitrogen and soil C while undisturbed sites exhibited positive correlation with C (P\u00e2\u2030\u00a4 0.05). On the basis of our findings, it is recommended that conservation agriculture be practiced in the River Nzoia and its drainage system.",

        "title": "The influence of land use on nutrient regime in a tropical stream",
        "description": "Pollution of inland waters by agricultural, industrial and municipal wastes is a global\r\nproblem and a common phenomenon in developing countries. These anthropogenic activities\r\nwithin the landscape facilitate the transfer of nutrients into aquatic ecosystems, sometimes\r\nleading to eutrophication which has adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. Deposition of\r\nnutrient-rich sediments washed into rivers and stream is common during rainy season in\r\nplaces where the riparian buffer zones have been destroyed. River Isiukhu watershed land\r\nuse comprises sugar-cane farm, forested, peri-urban and mixed agriculture from upstream to\r\ndowntream. The research employed stratified random sampling. Nitrate-nitrogen was\r\ndetermined through ultra-violet screening spectrophotometric method while phosphatephosphorus\r\nthrough ascorbic acid method. Data analyses were done using Statistical\r\nAnalysis System, version 9.1. Land use had a significant effect of both nitrate-nitrogen\r\n(F=1372.25, p<0.05) and phosphate-phosphorus concentrations. Peri-urban and mixed\r\nagricultural land uses recorded higher concentrations of these two nutrients while the forest\r\nland use recorded the lowest. The study showed that the type of riparian land use land cover\r\ninfluences nutrient concentrations in a water body and is an important area to be focused on\r\nby watershed managers.",

Data was collected from protection staffs and local communities found in and around the boundary of the national park. Open ended and close ended questionnaires, focused group discussion and field observation were used to collect all the necessary information. Protection staffs interview revealed that illegal fishing (100%), fuel wood collection (100%) and charcoal production (92.0%) were among the major problems of biodiversity in the study area. On the other hand, the data obtained from the villagers showed that 58.5 and 37.8% of them were involved in fuel wood collection and livestock grazing, respectively. Poor salary (96.0%), inadequate staffing (88.0%), lack of equipment (96.0%) and poor infrastructure (96.0%) were also among the major management problems that hinder the motivation of the park management staffs. Based on our research results, we could say that there is a rapid growing ecotourism activity in the study area. However, the long term effects of human threats to biodiversity had resulted and can have negative implications on the ecotourism activities and biodiversity of the study areas in the future.",

To do so, 20 m x 20 m (trees) inside which is 5 m x 5 m nest plots (shrubs and saplings), and 2 m x 2 m (seedlings) were laid. Vegetation data were collected using purposive sampling technique with quantitative measurements (DBH, density, seedling and sapling count). Furthermore, semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data about its socio-economic and ecological impacts. Results reveal that L. camara has shown highest invasion (82.1%, grassland) and least invasion (34.6%, riverine forest); cultivated land being intermediate (57.5%). Plant species density was high at the lower class (&lt;6cm DBH, 83.94% of total plants sampled). At species level, L. camara exhibited an inverted J-shaped frequency distribution (62.21 %&lt; 2 cm DBH), screening its greater regeneration potential. There was high diversity and species richness with H&rsquo;=2.6980, S=45 for natural riverside forest, H&rsquo;= 1.8173, S=28 cultivated land, and H&rsquo;=0.3446, S=14, grassland. Economic and ecological results revealed that Lantana was perceived as more disadvantageous; therefore the community highly recommends, if possible, its complete removal from the park.</p>",

The General Linear Model of SAS was used to compare means after fitting sources of variation to models. Growth rate of treatment animals was higher than that of control animals (P<0.05). Lambs grew about twice as fast as kids (P<0.05). Lower mortality rate was observed in treatment animals compared to control (P<0.05), partly contributing to higher birth rate observed in treatment animals (P<0.0001). A strong interaction was observed between community and type of animal (P<0.001). A net gain of US$5.65 was observed for each treatment animal compared to US $8.58/control animal (P<0.05). However, these profit margins were significantly affected (P<0.05) by the management practices of the farmers. The package resulted in increased birth rates so the concentrate feed could be tried on pregnant and lactating females.",

Thus, in the 6 plots with 77 trees, there were three plots in Inkou Forest Island site and three plots in Blue Lake Forest site. The results of this study showed that the average carbon stock in 6 plots of the study was 130.9908333 t C /ha for above-ground biomass (AGB) and 30.78283179 t C /ha for below-ground biomass (BGB). In this forest ecosystem, the average carbon stock of AGB was more important in secondary forest compared to gallery forest with respectively 135.9763333 t C /ha against 126.0053 t C /ha. Also, the average carbon stock of BGB was higher in secondary forest (31.9544076 t C /ha) compared to gallery forest (29.61126 t C /ha). This study shows that the species density is higher in the secondary forest (3 plots with 44 trees) compared to the gallery forest (3 plots with 33 trees).

        "description": "Raphia hookeri is a multi-purpose palm plant of high socio-cultural and economic values capable of providing array of both timber and non-timber forest products in Nigeria. Regrettably, natural stands of R. hookeri are grossly neglected and untapped for more viable and sustainable business in the Niger Delta. This paper highlights avenues for sustainable utilisation of the plant in the Niger Delta of Nigeria. The two main specific uses of R. hookeri in Niger Delta are palm wine and edible insect larvae (Rynchophorus phoenicis) from stem sap and wood (trunk). The production of these products is inconsistent with long-term environmental enhancement, because it is usually associated with death of the utilised palms. Developing higher value products capturing sustainability are very promising and can contribute to improving the success of economy diversification and good forest enterprises development in the zone. However, the evidenced behaviours and behavioural data had revealed what indigenous people are doing with forest and its associated resources. The abundance of this resource should be an impetus to produce baskets for other regions at the expense of baskets consumption being purchased from zones of less resource. It is therefore imperative for entrepreneurial institutions and centres to create more awareness on the prospect of abundant untapped resource. Interests should focus mainly on handicraft practices that can sustainably improve the local economies and ecology of the plants.",

        "description": "<p>Background and Purpose: Variation in wood is a common phenomenon. Eliciting information on the pattern and extent of variation in wood properties is crucial to knowing the end use of wood species. This to a larger extent helps in the efficient and sustainable utilization of wood. Pinus caribaea has been internationally affirmed to be suitable for the manufacturing of pulp and paper. Since its introduction into Nigeria, the possibility for its use for pulp and paper has been grossly undermined because of the non-functional paper mills in Nigeria. Hence, the established plantations of the species in the country have gradually been exploited for timber. In order to ensure the efficient use of the species for structural purposes, it is therefore pertinent to understand the variation pattern in its anatomical and physical properties. Materials and Methods: Five trees of 31 year old P. caribaea wood were harvested at Shasha Forest Reserve, South-West Nigeria. Bolts of 50 cm in length were obtained from each felled tree at breast height (1.3 m). Discs of 5 cm thickness were obtained from each bolt which were used for the anatomical investigation. The bolts were used for the investigation of the physical properties. The data generated were subjected to ANOVA and Regression Analysis. Results: The results show that considerable differences exist in the anatomical properties among trees (p&lt;0.05). The physical properties show no marked difference among trees (p&gt;0.05). Both the physical and anatomical properties differ insignificantly within the tree (p&gt;0.05). Tree&rsquo;s basic density, tracheid wall thickness and lumen diameter only explained 49% of the variation in the preservative absorption within the tree (R2=0.4884, P-value=0.053), re-emphasizing the major role played by bordered pits in the permeability of softwoods. conclusions: Due to the high preservative absorption observed using a non-pressure treatment, it is concluded that the species is very porous. Its porosity may pose a disadvantage when moisture absorption is concerned. Thus, it is recommended that the wood be properly treated in order to reduce its potentials in absorbing excessive moisture during service</p>",

        "description": "The need for environmental sustainability calls for a radical change from the use of synthetic \r\nwood preservatives which persist in the environment even after wood has been taken out of service. There has therefore been a growing interest in the development of efficacious biocides from plants, prompting the exploration of castor seed oil as a potential wood antifungal in this study due to its reported antimicrobial properties. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the resistance of castor oil treated P. caribaea wood against two strains of wood basidiomycetes. Five trees of Pinus caribaea were harvested at Shasha Forest Reserve, Osun State. Wood samples were obtained from the top, middle and base of the trees. The samples were conditioned and treated with four formulated fungicides prepared from mechanically extracted oil of castor seeds. The treated and control samples were inoculated with Sclerotium rolfsii (Brown rot) and Ganoderma lucidum (White rot) for 24 weeks. Parameters such as oil yield, preservative absorption, weight loss and compressive strength of the treated wood samples were determined. ANOVA was used in analyzing the data generated. Results show that the oil yield of the seed of the plant is 41.75%. The preservative absorption of the wood ranged between 114.85  - 277.12 (Kgm-3), weight loss (1.36  - 15.85%) and MCS// (33.05  - 48.35N/mm2). Sampling height and preservative concentration significantly influenced weight loss of the wood (p<0.05). The 30% preservative concentration performed best, having the least weight loss (1.71% and 1.61%) and highest MCS// (47.06N/mm2 and 44.65N/mm2) after exposure to S. rolfsii and \r\nG. lucidum, respectively. The brown rot (4.12%) was more virulent than the white rot (3.66%) on the basis of wood weight loss, however, the MCS// results indicated otherwise. It is concluded that castor seed oil is effective in protecting wood against white and brown rot fungi. \r\n \r\n",

        "description": "The demand for energy continues to increase with the increasing populace. There is therefore an energy deficit in Nigeria as demand has exceeded supply. The use of fossil fuels have their environmental implications while the intense exploitation of fuelwood from the forest continue to deplete the forest, resulting into widespread deforestation and its attendant consequences. However, the renewable energy sources in Nigeria are at different stages of exploitation and these may take longer than expected before their full potentials are realised. Thus, efficient and sustainable use of the most exploited biomass resource (woody biomass) becomes imperative in order to address the three-pronged problem of deforestation, improving energy supply and reducing GHG emissions from the use of fossil fuels. This paper therefore identifies solutions to these nagging energy and environmental problems which lies in the  development of inexpensive technologies such as fuel-efficient stoves, briquette presses, and pyrolysis apparatus  in energy generation; all  of  which  are  more efficient  in the conversion of woody biomass  into energy. Wastes from sawmills and other wood processing outfits are equally important in meeting the energy needs in the country as they are mostly disposed off in an environmentally unfriendly manner.",

        "description": "<p>Kenyan forests have been subjected to an ever increasing human demand of fuel wood, and other household economic activities leading to forest degradation, enhanced soil erosion, shortage of building materials and low quantity and quality of water supply. In pursuit of saving the environment, the Kenya Forest Service (KFS) formulated a policy which outlines the process by which the government of Kenya will develop a strategy for increasing cover of Kenyan forests. However, there is a concern of effectiveness in the formulation of the forest policy by the stakeholders. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the Kenyan Forest policy on management of Kenyan forests on the basis of its formulation and sustainability. The study was carried out in Eastern Mau because it is an area that has had intensive deforestation and hence loss of biodiversity. From the results (Table 1) indicate that forest conservation efforts are influenced by policy formulation. The high significant (F =16.845; p=0.0001) relationship between forest policy formulation and conservation implies that the more effort put in the formulation of the forest policy the better the forest conservation or management. The R2-value of 0.393 implies policy formulation accounts for 33.9% of the conservation efforts. The study recommends the need to fund the bodies assigned the mandate to formulate the policy to ensure the forest policy reach the intended people through training and consultations. Key words: Forest policy, Forest Degradation, Mau Forest, Policy Formulation</p>",

        "title": "Differential Mangroves Degradation Rates: Case of Tudor and Mwache Creeks, Mombasa, Kenya ",
        "description": "Limited economic opportunities and legislations in the Kenyan coast led to widespread mangroves degradation. This was despite the recognition that mangroves capture about 3-5 times more carbon per unit area than any vegetated ecosystem. Globally, studies assessing differential degradation rates are limited and rarely existent in Kenyan scenario. This study sought to establish the disparities in degradation rates along the Kenyan coastline by assessing two highly impacted creeks: Tudor and Mwache in a peri-urban setting as a case study. The total ecosystem carbon stock was estimated at 131.64\u00c2\u00b157.3C t ha-1 comprising of 66.22\u00c2\u00b16.3t/ha AGC, 20.7\u00c2\u00b10.2t ha-1 BGC and 44.34\u00c2\u00b12.05C t ha-1 SOC and 293.35\u00c2\u00b147.2t ha-1 comprising of 87.35\u00c2\u00b138.66t ha-1 AGC; 30.28\u00c2\u00b113.22t ha-1 BGC and 175.71\u00c2\u00b146.72C t ha-1 from the sediments for Tudor and Mwache creek respectively. The results show that Tudor creek is more degraded than Mwache creek. There is a need to strengthen the governance regimes through enforcement and compliance to address anthropogenic pressures. Advocating for an ecosystem approach in mangrove conservation. Management strategies suggested initiating and providing residents with alternative and cheap sources of energy, building materials and enforcing a complete moratorium on wood extraction to allow recovery. Achievement will highly depend on the good will of the stakeholders.  \r\n \r\nKeywords: Differential degradation, Anthropogenic drivers, Mangrove degradation, Carbon stock. \r\n",

        "description": "<p>This study evaluates recent spatiotemporal variability and trends in rainfall and temperature in the central highlands of Ethiopia by using monthly rainfall and temperature records. The monthly rainfall data are for 132 points of 10 &times; 10 km grids reconstructed from weather stations and meteorological satellite observations, which cover the period between 1983 and 2013. The monthly maximum and minimum temperatures are for the same points and girds, but cover the period 1981&ndash;2011. Linear regression is used to each of the 132 grid points to detect changes or trends in rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures and the statistical significance of the trends is determined by the F-distribution test. These points were reclassified into the three districts (Woredas in Amharic) studied having different agroecologies by extraction techniques with ArcGIS 10.1 and converted into raster to generate surface data using simple krigging interpolation technique. Annual and June&ndash;September (Kiremt) rainfall exhibit statistically insignificant increasing trends in most of the grid points while March&ndash;May (Belg) rainfall shows significant decreasing trends. On the other hand, significant spatiotemporal variability in the maximum and minimum temperatures is observed across the study area. The warming trends in the maximum and minimum temperatures for Basona Werana and Efratana Gidim, respectively, are statistically significant at p = .05 and p = .01 levels. It is concluded that trends of rainfall and temperature vary considerably within the study area. This indicates the need for local-level analysis, and context-specific planning and implementation of climate change adaptation interventions.</p>",

        "description": "This study describes the different coping and adaptation strategies used by smallholder farmers to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change and variability in the central highlands of Ethiopia. A distinction was made between coping and adaptation strategies respectively as short-term and longer-term measures. The study surveyed 200 farm households in three districts, and three focus group discussions and three key informant interviews were conducted in each district. All the surveyed farmers perceived at least one aspect of change in the local climate. Their perception of an increasing trend of temperature was supported by meteorological records while their perception of declining annual rainfall was not supported by actual records in two of the three districts, where positive trends in rainfall were observed. Farmers identified changes in rainfall and drought as their major climate change related risks. In response, farmers used different strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and variability. The most widely used coping strategy was selling livestock (85% of the respondents), followed by changing consumption pattern (76% of the respondents). Changing crop planting dates was the most preferred adaptation option (89% of the respondents) while irrigation as an adaptation strategy was used only by 10% of the surveyed farmers. Shortage of water for irrigation (83% of the respondents) and shortage of money to buy necessary inputs (77% of the respondents) were the major barriers to effective adaptation frequently cited in the study area. We conclude that adaptation policy should build on existing coping and adaptation strategies and focus on addressing barriers to the adoption of coping and adaptation measures at different scales. ",

        "description": "The aim of this study was to understand the association of crop production with climate variability in the central highlands of Ethiopia. We used monthly rainfall and temperature data from 132 points each representing a pixel of 10\u00c3\u201410 km, which are reconstructions based on station records and meteorological satellite observations. Production data of five major crops for the main cropping season, locally known as Meher, were collected for the period 2004-2013 for three districts (Baso Werana, Efratana Gidim and Menz Gera Meder) from the Central Statistical Agency (CSA). The production data are at the Enumeration Area (EA) level and hence the best available dataset on crop production. Therefore, there is no published local scale study, as is attempted here, on local scale climate variability and crop production in the country insofar as it is known to the authors. Correlation analysis shows that crop production and cultivated area are positively correlated with rainfall, but negatively associated with maximum and minimum temperatures except for one of the districts,Basona Werana,  where production of all crops are positively associated with the minimum temperature. Production of four out of five crops in Basona Werana and three out of five crops in both Efratana Gidim and and Menz Gera Meder, showed declines over the period of study; regression results indicating rainfall to be the most important determinant of production levels. It is concluded that current climate variability has a significant influence on crop production in the area and any unfavorable change in the local climate in the future will have serious implications for household level food security. Efforts to adapt to the ongoing climate change should begin from tackling the current climate variability and take a climate risk management approach for adapting to the ongoing climate change.     \r\n\r\n",

        "description": "Wood is one of the natural products of the forest that has been in use throughout the whole world. In many countries of the world, wood is considered the most important of all the forest resources available. This is so because wood is versatile and is a raw material for many constructional end-uses. Therefore, the study assessed the density of Borassus aethiopum in different ecological zones in Nigeria. Five B. aethiopum trees each from Sudan, Guinea and Derived savannah zones in Nigeria were sampled at the base (10%), middle (50%) and top (90%) of the merchantable length and partitioned into six part from bark to bark along the radial plane and the density was evaluated. The experimental design adopted for the study was a two factor split plot design and data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Analysis of variance was carried out at 0.05. Density values were 910.50 \u00c2\u00b120.37kg/m3, 691.34\u00c2\u00b117.22kg/m3 and 454.04\u00c2\u00b18.99kg/m3 for base, middle and top portions of the tree, respectively. Radially, from the outer wood to the inner wood, density ranged between 1467.19\u00c2\u00b139.50kg/m3 to 545.15\u00c2\u00b122.09kg/m3 at the base, 1050.73\u00c2\u00b167.66kg/m3 to 466.12\u00c2\u00b129.04kg/m3 at the middle and 660.67\u00c2\u00b110.93kg/m3 to 280.54\u00c2\u00b119.31kg/m3 at\r\nthe top. B. aethiopum density was 679.96\u00c2\u00b122.85kg/m3, 687.90\u00c2\u00b149.11kg/m3 and\r\n687.80\u00c2\u00b187.21kg/m3 for Derived savannah, Sudan savannah and Guinea savannah,\r\nrespectively. Significant variations were not observed across the three ecological\r\nzones, but significant variations were observed along the sampling height and radial\r\npositions. Borassus aethiopum wood could be classified as heavy density wood",

        "description": "Natural durability of the wood of Borassus aethiopum was evaluated to assess its utilization potentials. Samples for the study were collected from natural forest locations in three ecological zones in Nigeria, namely: Derived savannah, Sudan savannah and Guinea savannah. Five trees were sampled at base (10 %), middle (50 %) and top (90 %) of the merchantable height and from bark to bark radially from each of the ecological zones. A split plot statistical method was used to test the significance of the variability in the percentage weight loss at 5% probability level. The percentage weight loss was 15.32 \u00c2\u00b1 0.05 % with mean value 10.37 \u00c2\u00b1 0.02 % at the base, 12.21 \u00c2\u00b1 0.21 % at the middle and 23.40 \u00c2\u00b1 0.11 % at the top. Across the bole, it ranges from 0% to 31.18\u00c2\u00b10.21% at the base, 0% to 34.57 \u00c2\u00b1 1.31 % at the middle and 0% to 61.16\u00c2\u00b10.78% at the top. However, among the ecological zones, highest weight loss was observed in Derived savannah followed by Guinea savannah and Sudan savannah with 15.98 \u00c2\u00b1 0.01 %, 15.26 \u00c2\u00b1 0.35 % and 14.75 \u00c2\u00b1 0.11 % respectively.\r\nAccording to the rating, the outer wood, middle wood and inner wood are rated. We observed trace of termite attack: moderate termite attack and heavy termite attack respectively in accordance with ASTM D1758-74. We conclude that the outer wood of B. aethiopum can be used without preservation because termite was unable to destroy it but every other part (centre and inner wood) must be preserved to increase the service year",

        "description": "This study was conducted to evaluate variations in the natural durability of B. aethiopum. Five B. aethiopum trees each from Sudan, Guinea and Derived savanna zones in Nigeria were sampled at the base (10%), middle (50%) and top (90%) of the merchantable length. Weight loss experiment was used to assess natural durability by inoculating wood samples with Sclerotium rolfsii (Brown rot fungi) and Pleurotus florida (White rot fungi) for 24 weeks. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and ANOVA. Brown rot fungi degraded B. aethiopum wood by 27.1\u00c2\u00b10.5%, 36.8\u00c2\u00b10.3% and 49.7\u00c2\u00b11.8% while, white rot reduced weight of samples by 24.8\u00c2\u00b10.5%, 33.3\u00c2\u00b10.7% and 42.1\u00c2\u00b10.6%, at the base, middle and top, respectively. Radially, Brown rot degraded wood by 5.0\u00c2\u00b10.07%, 26.6\u00c2\u00b11.2% and 81.9\u00c2\u00b12.8%, while white rot\r\ndegraded it by 4.0\u00c2\u00b10.01%, 19.4\u00c2\u00b12.2% and 76.9\u00c2\u00b15.1% in the outer wood, centre wood and inner wood, respectively. Significant variation was not observed across the ecological zones, but there was significant difference radially and along the sampling height. It was observed that fungi naturally attack the wood of B. aethiopum especially when the condition is favourable, but the outer is resistant to fungi while other parts (centre and inner wood) are susceptible to fungi attack.",

        "description": "<p>The resulting dimensional changes in wood are one of the major sources of defects in furniture and other wood structure. This paper therefore assesses the shrinkage level of Bambusa vulgaris along the three planes to explore its dimensional stability. Test specimens of 10 cm length and different thickness and width were prepared for this test at the base (5%), middle (50%) and top (90%) of the merchantable length of the culm. They were properly aligned and denoted &lsquo;T&rsquo;, &lsquo;R&rsquo; and &lsquo;L&rsquo; for Tangential, Radial and Longitudinal planes, respectively. They were soaked in water for 48 hrs in order to get them conditioned to moisture above Fibre Saturation Point (FSP).Specimens were removed one after the other and their dimensions in wet condition were taken to the nearest millimetre with the aids of veneer slide calliper. The specimens were oven dried to 12% moisture content and their dimensions were taken. Then the shrinkage was evaluated along the three planes and data were subjected to analysis of variance The Tangential, Radial, Longitudinal and Volumetric shrinkage were 4.55&plusmn;1.77, 5.61&plusmn;2.19, 0.19&plusmn;0.12 and 10.35&plusmn;2.77, respectively. For longitudinal shrinkage it was 0.11&plusmn;0.06, 0.22&plusmn;0.11 and 0.22&plusmn;0.15 at the top, middle and base, respectively. It was 6.17&plusmn;2.35 at top, 5.67&plusmn;2.07 at middle and 5.00&plusmn;2.09 at the base for radial shrinkage while the tangential shrinkage was 4.42&plusmn;1.77, 4.77&plusmn;1.88 and 4.46&plusmn;1.69 at the top, middle and base, respectively. The volumetric was 10.70&plusmn;2.93 at the top, 10.66&plusmn;2.66 at the middleand 9.69&plusmn;2.71 at the base. The result of ANOVA shows that there is significant difference along the sampling height for longitudinal shrinkage, but no significant difference was observed for tangential, radial shrinkage and volumetric shrinkage at 5% level of probability. From this study, it can be concluded that B. vulgaris is slightly dimensionally stable.</p>",

        "description": "Scarcity of choice timber species in Nigeria necessitates research into alternative species.\r\nEfficient utilisation of alternative species such as Borassus aethiopum requires adequate\r\nunderstanding of their wood properties and within tree variations. However, information on\r\npotential of B. aethiopum as alternative to choice timber has not been adequately documented\r\nespecially in the area of durability. This study was therefore conducted to evaluate variations in\r\nthe natural durability of B. aethiopum in different ecological zones in Nigeria\r\nFive B. aethiopum trees each from Sudan, Guinea and Derived savanna zones in Nigeria were\r\nsampled at the base (10%), middle (50%) and top (90%) of the merchantable length and\r\npartitioned into outerwood, centrewood and innerwood along the radial plane. Weight loss (WL)\r\nexperiment was used to assess natural durability by exposing wood samples to termite\r\n(Macrotermis bellicosus) for 12 months in a graveyard experiment. Wood samples were also\r\ninoculated with Sclerotium rolfsii (Brown rot fungi) and Pleurotus florida (White rot fungi) for\r\n24 weeks in an accelerated durability test (ADT) using standard procedure.

        "description": "Daniellia oliveri is a species of great economic value being used as pole, fuel wood, charcoal, food, shade and shelter. The prodigious usefulness of which has compelled efforts towards its multiplication and domestication. The study therefore investigated the effects of sowing depth and mulching on emergence and growth of D. oliveri seedlings. \r\nSeeds of D. oliveri collected from Saki, Ilorin and Ogbomoso were scarified and sown on germination beds. The experimental design was 3 x 3 x 2 factorial in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replicates. Shoot height, Collar diameter, Leaf production and leaf area were assessed. While Emergence percentage, Emergence Index and Emergence Rate Index were evaluated and subjected to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).\r\nAccession had significant influence on emergence and growth of seedlings, with Ilorin provenance recording higher E% values (62.6) compared to the other two provenances. Its ERI value (131.5) was lower than that of Ogbomoso (145.8) but similar to that of Saki (142.3). Seedling growth characters varied widely at all times of measurement. Mulching, or its absence, did not significantly affect the amount and speed of emergence.\r\nIt is therefore recommended that average weight of D. oliveri of probably sufficient food reserves should be planted at sowing depth of 2 to 4 cm without mulching for maximum growth potential.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Daniellia oliveri, Accession, Emergence percentage, Emergence Index and Emergence Rate Index\r\n",

        "description": "Pruning involves the removal of live and dead branches along lower trunks of forest trees in order to produce clear knot-free timber. Nauclea diderrichii often produce multiple branches (Fig 1) which usually leads to knotty bole when harvested and thus lower the economic values of it. Therefore the study investigated the effects of different levels of pruning on the growth of N. diderrichii.\r\nAssessment of effects of different levels of pruning on the growth potentials of N. diderrichii was carried out on two years old plantation of the species. The study was made up of 5 treatments combination replicated 5 times in a randomized complete block design (RCBD). The result revealed that there were significant differences among the treatments at 5% level of probability in the height, girth diameter and number of branches within the period of study. The highest mean growth in height and number of branches was recorded in T1, (184.68cm and 13.38 respectively) while the highest mean girth of 13.86cm was given by T4. The study showed that partial pruning induced optimum growth and development of Nauclea diderrichii which could be vastly used for timber production. It is recommended that partial pruning of 25% and 50% should be applied to Nauclea diderrichii plantation in order to achieve vigorous, clean and straight bole stand of the species.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Pruning, Branches, Knot-free, straight bole and Nauclea diderrichii\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "Maize production in Malawi is limited mainly by low soil N and P. Improved fallows of N-fixing legumes such as Tephrosia and Sesbania offer options for improving soil fertility particularly N supply.The interactions of Tephrosia fallows and inorganic fertilizers on soil properties, N uptake, and maize yields were evaluated at Chitedze Research Station in Malawi. The results indicated that the level of organic matter and pH increased in all the treatments except for the control. Total N remained almost unchanged while available P decreased in all plots amended with T. vogelii but increased in T. candida plots where inorganic P was applied.\r\nExchangeable K increased in all the plots irrespective of the type of amendment. The  interaction of N and P fertilizers with T. vogelii fallows significantly increased the grain yield. The treatment that received 45 kgNha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 and 20 kg P ha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 produced significantly\r\nhigher grain yields (6.8 t ha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191) than all the other treatments except where 68 kgNha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 and 30 kg P ha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 were applied which gave 6.5 t ha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 of maize grain. T. candida fallows alone or in combination with N and P fertilizers did not significantly affect grain yield. However, T. candida fallows alone can raise maize grain yield by 300%over the no-input control. Based on these results we conclude that high quality residues such as T. candida and T. vogelii can be used as sources of nutrients to improve crop yields and soil fertility in N-limited soils. However, inorganic P fertilizer is needed due to the low soil available P levels.",

        "description": "The main input of nutrients in agroforestry systems is achieved through biomass decomposition. A study was carried out to determine the rates of decomposition and N and P release pattern from T. vogelii and T. candida plant residues using litterbag experiments in Malawi. The plant residue treatments included Tephrosia biomass alone or in combination with maize stover. For each treatment, sixteen replicates of litter bags were buried in the soil at the depth of 20cm and Samples were drawn from each litter bag at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 week intervals and were analyzed to determine remaining dry matter weight (DMW), N and P. The fastest decomposition rates (k) recorded when T. vogelii or T. candida leaves + twigs + stover were combined, while the slowest was when twigs alone or maize stover alone were used. The Tephrosia residues were high in N (>3.5%) and P (critical value of >2.0%). The N release rates were fastest from twigs of T. vogelii or T. candida followed by maize stover\r\nalone, while the slowest release was when T. vogelii leaves were combined with twigs. P release pattern from residues was the same as N release. No N and P immobilization was observed throughout the study period. The results have clearly demonstrated that that the Tephrosia fallow biomass alone decompose considerably faster attaining their half-life within 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 weeks and over 95% within 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 weeks but when mixed with maize stover (alow quality farm residues) decomposition was slowed down. Therefore, Tephrosia fallow biomass can be used for short-term correction of soil fertility.",

The sampling was done in 30 plots of 25 x 25 m2 in which all trees with a dbh&ge;10 cm were inventoried. The Shannon, Simpson and Evenness indexes were calculated to characterize the diversity of trees associated with cocoa. 62 species belonging to 48 genera and 27 families were identified, the Anacardiaceae, Moraceae, Caesalpiniaceae, Mimosaceae and Rutaceae, were revealed the most diverse families, with 5 species each. Shannon&rsquo;s (3.66), Evenness&rsquo;s (0.76) and Simpson&rsquo;s (0.96) indexes have reflected a low diversity, dominated by some few species. The average density of cocoa trees is 1028 trees/ha. They store about 22.51&plusmn;5.86 Mg C/ha. Associated trees stored 124.20&plusmn;60.05Mg C/ha for tree density of 113 trees/ha. These CAF sequestered about 146.71Mg C/ha. The multiple correspondence analyses showed that carbon stocks in the CAF are positively correlated with the associated trees and the age of the CAF and negatively correlated with the abundance of cocoa trees. The biomass of cocoa is independent of the associated trees, but is inversely related to the density of the associated trees.</p>",

        "description": "The study assessed the competitive performance of the furniture enterprises in ibid an, Nigeria. Data were collected from four randomly selected Local Government Areas (LGA):-Ibadan North, Ibadan South East,  Ido and Akinyele.Purposice sampling was used to select the wooden furniture makers.\r\nStochastic production frontier  was used to analyse the technical efficiency amongst the furniture makers.  The mean efficiency of 0.5953 was obtained ,indicating room for furniture production efficiency improvement by 41.0%.The production function revealed that 35.0% of the variation in output was due to disparity in input and technology, while 48.5% of the furniture makers were technically efficient.\r\nA production variable with positive coefficient and significant influence on furniture production in the study area was wood. The return to scale (RTS) was 1.368 indicating increasing returns to scale,  which implied that furniture producers may need to increase the use of productive resources and improved machinery. The furniture producers were also not innovative in their marketing and production processes. The major contributing factors to efficiency were age and education  (p <001). Majority of the furniture makers identified poor funding, (18.7%), expensive tools (18. 7%), epileptic power supply (17.8%), low valuation of furniture products (14.7%), and poor patronage (14.0%), amongst others as the constraint faced in furniture production.To attain a sustainable and thriving industry government should intervene through the provision of credit facilities as well as training and capacity building for furniture makers.",

        "description": "<p>Community forestry, promoted as a &ldquo;win&ndash;win&rdquo; forest management strategy yielded a variety of results that includes both failure and relative success. The willingness of government to hold control over forest resources while transferring only part of property rights to local communities is one of the major constraints. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative approaches,which enhance the position and accountability of local communities in community forestmanagement. This study evaluated socio-economic and ecological outcomes of community forestry in a context of important property rights conceded to local communities. The study was conducted using focus groups discussions, forest income evaluation and assessment of forest resources and their dynamics. Findings showed that institutional designwith important property rights conceded to local communities partially empowered local communities and reduced threatswhile improving the condition of forest resources. The approach also yielded positive economic outcomes that enabled bordering populations to make up to 25% of their global annual income fromthe forest. However, the sustainability of this scheme of forestmanagement was mostly limited by the financial dependency on local non-governmental organization, by local institutions and discrepancy in forest benefits sharing among local forest users.</p>",

        "description": "The current global economy is characterised by a growing disparity in wealth between the rich and the poor nations. In order to redress this inequality, the Millennium Development Goals have been established and their progress benchmarked with annual reports. \r\n\r\nIn South Africa the challenge of resolving the inequitable distribution of resources is addressed through a policy founded upon a symbiotic relationship of support between the industrial, First Economy and the marginalised, Second Economy. This is a process promoted as an African solution to resolving the weak economic performance of a continent which is heavily dependent on mineral extraction, agriculture and forestry. A prime vehicle for validating this initiative is the South African Forest Industry, one that is highly commercialised and profitable, yet situated amongst impoverished, marginalised rural communities.  The enabling tool to realise a more equitable distribution of forest resources is the Forest Sector Transformation Charter (2007), which is referred to as the Charter. \r\n\r\nTo demonstrate how a successful transition in South African forestry can be achieved through the Charter, the current positions and future needs of the state (which also represents the communities), the commercial industry, as well as recent tertiary forestry curricula are outlined. Further support for this transition is provided by a review of an on-going forestry programme of technology transfer which strengthens the conceptual debate. Finally, with inputs from inter-African dialogue, the Forest Sector Transformation Charter is promoted as the basis for new South African Forestry curricula templates which can be adopted elsewhere in Africa. \r\n\r\n \r\n",

        "description": "This report summarizes the organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in the year 2016 in areas of programs and organizational development. It highlights priorities set; key implemented actions and core outcomes as well as challenges.\r\n\r\nThe preparation and implementation of the CTECO plans will involve mainly people living in poverty and GNDR Tanzanian CSOs with whom CTECO has alliance, One Health Tanzania through USAID, NPA-VAWC through DFID, AFF, UNCCD and PMO \u00e2\u20ac\u201c DMD stakeholders.\r\n\r\nIn due course of all community engagement processes, efforts to meet DRR needs and ensure community empowerment, solidarity and campaigning are accomplished, CTECO will employ either using GNDR Frontline or Community Management methodologies which comprehensive engage community participatory resiliency.\r\n\r\nUnder strategic objective one and two; the focus will be on community based disaster management and empowering teamwork amidst CSOs to promote community resilience which is effective and affordable. As a result; series of interventions, and notable results will achieved including increased DRR and frontline/community management awareness and consciousness for CSOs reflecting actions to be taken in the Dodoma region and the Country at large.\r\n\r\nCTECO is working in partnership with GNDR registered Tanzanian CSOs and the East Africa regional secretariat to implement the GNDR strategy plan 2016-2020, by conducting frontline/community management programs on disasters in communities and sharing findings with relevant stakeholders by way of advocating for enhanced commitment to community resilience. As a result of collective efforts, funds will be solicited for both institution and program support from stakeholders and the local governments in some districts to support provision of community resiliency. Following the invitations, workshops, facilitative leadership training provided by OCHU, and the professionalism of its Directors; we believe addressing challenges of DRR in communities is part of volunteerism our communities can benefit from.\r\n\r\nUnder strategic objective three; the focus will be on interventions, awareness and prevention of violence against women and children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights increased holistically among women and children as well as the larger society in operational NPA-VAWC strategy plan, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still in consultative meetings with the DFID UKaid to see how CTECO and other Dodoma CSOs shall work with DFID UKaid to implement the NPA-VAWC in the Dodoma region.\r\n\r\nUnder strategic objective four; Under Governance, and TRA, the focus has been on assessment of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awareness on the importance and processes of tax revenue collection and utilization, conducting consultative meetings and trainings with Dodoma businessmen and women especially the small investors as well as supporting the use of EFD TRA machines so as to boost the tax collection base with expectation of the government to be in position to improve on the standard of living of her people and also be in position to adequately fund and budget for DRR activities in communities. \r\n\r\nUnder strategic objective five; the focus will be on interventions, awareness and prevention of cutting down trees thus change the mind set of people to Promote the sustainable tree plantation and control over desertification by planting trees, and have local policies in place to control the movement and use of plastic bags which we believe will drastically improve drainage systems in communities by having consultative meetings with local leaders, law enforcers, and the people taking on Dodoma region as a pilot project in the country..\r\n\r\nUnder the human resources and organizational development initiatives, CTECO is undergoing serious restructuring to align itself to the stakeholders funded programs and institutional funding realities.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, CTECO is still housing in rented premises located in Chang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ombe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Juu, Dodoma, however plans are underway to build our official headquarters in Nkuhungu West, Plot 94, also plans are in place to build a DRR training institution pending funds from GNDR networked and funding partners.\r\n\r\nIn terms of financial performance, CTECO heavily relies on membership contributions to fund its activities, this has drastically affected our performance to cover a large area however with the incoming of One Health and DFID on board, there was a general trend to sustain DRR activities in the region and also embark on reserving funds for other DRR forthcoming programs.\r\n\r\nParticipatory Review and Reflection Processes (PRRPs) will be facilitated twice in every year at local level involving communities, and CTECO will work hand in hand with relevant actors/stakeholders to have the plan performance being openly reviewed to ensure accountability and transparency. The same exercise is to be done once involving representatives of communities, partners and government stakeholders from various levels. Moreover, continuous monitoring will be done to ensure the implementation process is on the right track and adjustments are done when needed. These exercises will added value towards improving efficiency in planning and implementing the DRR program.\r\n",

        "title": "Environmental Impact Assessment for the proposed Wash Plant Tailings and Lead Plant Tailings for Enviro Processing Limited in Kabwe",
        "description": "\r\nThis report is an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of Enviro Processing Limited (EPL), a Zambian registered company that is a 100% subsidiary of Berkeley Mineral Resources Plc (BMR) of the United Kingdom (UK), for the treatment of former Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) Kabwe Division washing Plant Tailings (WPT) and Leach Plant Tailings (LPT) to produce zinc and lead. Kabwe is among the top 10 most polluted areas in the world mainly due to the occurrence of lead.The proponent of the project therefore, proposes removal of harmful base metals from the Kabwe area and clean tailings contained within current dump siteby processing the Wash plant Tailings (WPT) and the Leach plant Tailings (LPT) as concentrates for export using Sulphide precipitation method. The WPT and LPT described above are fine materials containing heavy metals mainly lead and zinc. \r\nEPL proposes to undertake the proposed project at the investment of USD 2.5 Million. However, the project is going to operate for a period of 10 years. From the inception of the implementation phase, EPL aim to accomplish the following objectives:\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tRemoval of harmful   base metals from the area and clean tailings contained within current dump site. The remediation is to include:\r\n\t- Continuous dust reduction programmes\r\n\t- Continuous ground water monitoring programmes\r\n\t- Continuous community engagement programmes; with the tasks to:\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tprotect public health and safety;\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\treduce or prevent damage to the environment;\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\trestore mine land and where possible make it available for productive use; and\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tPromote better environmental practices in the mining sector.\r\n\r\nFor a period of three years, EPL has been using gravity separation processing as a means of recovering Lead and Zinc from the tailings dumps. However, this process is less efficient, expensive and generates streams that require further processing and is detrimental if discarded into the environment. \r\n\r\nLately, EPL has further investigated alternative metallurgical processes to recover Lead and Zinc. To this, research into an acid leaching process was initiated as part of the investigation process to find a technically viable process, not only for the Washing Plant Tailings but also the much larger dump of Leach residue. Laboratory scale test work that provide a unique and patentable process that will recover significantly more lead from the two materials and produce a residue where any remaining lead would be in a totally unreactive state were concluded. The process does not generate any discard streams that are environmentally detrimental. This process is highly beneficial.\r\nAfter undertaking research, EPL has proposed sulphide precipitation as an alternative viable metallurgical process which is more efficient, cost effective and environmentally friendly. This technique of sulphide precipitation can recover much of the base metals including Lead, hence leaving a much needed cleaner environment at Kabwe.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the project being proposed is a Kabwe Development Project-Zinc and Lead and Other Resources (KDPZLOR) to be established near the old mine dumps to be within the EPL mine licence area. It was observed during the assessment that the proposed project site is the brownfield area. Therefore, the implementation of the project will not have significant impact on the biophysical environment. However, impacts that likely to emanate from the project are classifield as follows:\r\n\r\nNegative impact\r\nThe significant impacts that will be associated with the project are but not limited to the following:\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tNoise  and vibration\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tAir quality\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tDisturbance of native vegetation\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tSoil disturbance, compaction or erosion\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tDisturbance to scientific and cultural sites\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tFauna disturbance\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tVisual disturbance or impacts\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tFire\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tGroundwater wastage or contamination\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tDumping waste.\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tDamage to road infrastructure and \r\nOther socio-economic related impacts. (HIV/AIDS, Safety and Risk\r\n\r\nPositive impacts\r\n\r\n The following are some of the positive impacts that will emanate from the inception of the project:\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tRemoval of the existing tailing material and production of environmentally friendly substances, hence creating a cleaner and health atmosphere;\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tCreating employment opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject alternative\r\nThere are three elements whose alternatives need to be considered. These are stated below:\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tSite alternative\r\n\r\nOption A: Select an alternative site\r\n\r\nThis option would mean abandoning the identified WPT and LPT, thereby bringing the proposed tailings processing activities to a halt, because mining is about the presence of mineral resources. It would also mean that the company would have to re-apply to Government for a different location for exploration of lead and zinc. This option would   be counterproductive, in the sense that the project would not be implemented. On the other hand however, the identified adverse impacts of the project would also not arise.The mine site has good road network which will be used to transport the tailing materials to the plant for processing. However, water sprays will be used to suppress the dust particles emanating from the mining activities.\r\n\r\nOption B: Mine in the Kabwe Mine Area\r\n\r\nThis option would take advantage of the identified mineral resource at the Kabwe Mine site. Information gathered so far indicates that there are lead and zinc mineral resources within the EPL mine licences of up to an estimated total of 57 million tonnes at grades of Zn 3.39% and Pb 1.39%. \r\nMining projects are dependent on the presence of a mineral resource, therefore the choice is that either the project is undertaken where the mineral resource is, or there will be no project at all\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tMining Methods Alternatives\r\n \r\nOption A: Mining with frontend loaders\r\n\r\nThe WPT and LPT are loose unconsolidated fines that were the waste product of previous zinc and lead concentration processes which included fine milling, flotation and leaching. The tailings were deposited on the disposal site over the life of the Kabwe Mine operating activities. The recovery of these fines for re-processing does not require any blasting as they are not consolidated, but are loose so that they can be dislodged and moved by means of frontend loaders.\r\nOption B: Consolidated Open Pit Mining \r\nThe use of consolidated rock open pit mining methods is inappropriate for these WPT and LPT as they are loose, mining waste deposits.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tProcessing Methods Alternatives\r\n\r\nOption A: Gravity Concentration and Magnetic Separation\r\n\r\nThis alternative is based on the fact that the zinc and lead minerals have a higher specific gravity than the gangue minerals in the Kabwe ores. In this application gravity concentration through the Humphrey spirals, mozely concentrator, and the subsequent clean-up of the zinc and lead concentrate by means of the magnetic separator to remove magnetically susceptible minerals from the concentrate produces a consolidated 45% combined zinc and lead concentrate which is saleable. The EPL circuit has evolved from deliberate laboratory investigations of mineral samples taken from the WPT and LPT.\r\n\r\nOption B: Gravity concentration and flotation and other options\r\n\r\nThis option is workable however, it would not be as efficient as the EPL proposed circuit because the tailings are in oxide form and flotation is expected to be more inefficient than if the zinc and lead minerals are sulphides. The net effect of this option is to produce a lower recovery of the zinc and lead than the proposed EPL circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIA Team\r\nThe environmental impact assessment was conducted by a team from JA Consultant directed by Dr.J.H.Masinja with vast experience on environmental impact assessment. The table below show the names of the professional who took part in the EIA process:\r\n\r\nName\tJob Title\tSignature\r\nDr.Juwette H. Masinja\tEnvironmental Management Specialist and EIA Co-ordinator\t \r\nMr. Michael M Mundia\tTechnical Officer\r\nEnv and Social Sciences\r\n\t \r\nMr. Tembo Shadrach\tTechnical Officer Environmental, Energy and Mining\t \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear from the foregoing that the proposed new processing method of WPT and LPT by EPL will produce a higher concentrate of a combination of zinc and lead for sale under environmentally acceptable conditions. About 50 direct jobs will be created with the possibility of more jobs in the second phase and more other projects to follow. The project proponent will execute the project following the stipulate regulations according to the Environmental Management Act (EMA) No 12 of 2011 and apply the mitigation measures stated in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) of this EIA with a goal of enhance positive impacts. Therefore, the project is highly recommended to the ZEMA for approval.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeoff Casson\r\nGeneral Manager\r\nEnviro Processing Plc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "title": "The use of sawdust as an alternative fuel to charcoal in households",
        "description": "The purpose of carrying out this study was to determine the suitability of sawdust as an alternative fuel to charcoal in a quest to reduce the deforestation rate that has mainly been attributed to charcoal production. The main objective was to reduce dependency on charcoal as the primary source of domestic energy which in turn would reduce the rate of deforestation due to charcoal production activities. Deforestation which is the loss of tree cover, usually as a result of forests being cleared for other human activities has been found to have negative effects on the environment including driving climate change. Southern African forests have been heavily cleared mainly because they provide good fuel wood for fire wood and charcoal production. Hence there is need to find other suitable sources of energy for household use that will help to reduce total dependence on charcoal. The performance of the sawdust stove in terms of cooking duration and specific fuel consumption was compared with charcoal. The experiment was conducted on five different days and times translating into five trials. Maize samp was used to determine the cooking duration and fuel consumption when cooking using sawdust and also charcoal. Results obtained indicated that it took less time and fuel material to cook with the sawdust stove than charcoal. With these advantages of sawdust over charcoal, there is need to promote the use of wood sawdust as an alternative fuel to charcoal. Turning to wood sawdust as an alternative fuel to charcoal will reduce deforestation pressure. Another advantage that wood sawdust has over charcoal is that it is obtainable almost free of charge apart from the cost of transportation. Thus turning to sawdust will enable households avoid buying charcoal and save money for other needs. Further research can be carried out to ascertain the health aspect of wood sawdust to humans during cooking and also the feasibility of commercializing sawdust so that it can be made available on the market but at a low cost for many people to access it.",

        "title": "Spartial Distribution of Carterpillars in Serenje Distirct",
        "description": "In assessing the role forests play in the daily lives of the people who live in and around forests, the importance of non-wood forest products (NWFP) is often overlooked. Forests provide a number of other products which include the provision of building and construction materials in the form of fibre, bamboos, rattan, and grass for thatching. In the form of food and apart from fruits, Caterpillars happen to be one of the very valuable non-wood forest products which are harvested in great quantities. Serenje District is one of the areas in Zambia where caterpillar breeding and collection takes place but very little research has been done on them especially on their distribution, harvesting methods and their effects on forest preservation. This research report is therefore adapted to highlight the results of the study on the spatial distribution of caterpillars in Serenje District and location of the exact areas where they are found to occur. In the survey, the pattern of distribution was obtained and this culminated in the production of maps depicting spatial distribution of caterpillars. Geographical Information System (GIS) was used as a tool of data analysis and mapping. It was found that there are seven major types of caterpillars commonly harvested in Serenje and that the distribution is concentrated on the northern part of the district. The main vegetation type is Miombo woodland with Julbernardia paniculata as the most preferred host tree species by most of the caterpillar types. Use of late fire is very common in the areas identified and harvesting is mainly done by cutting trees down. These must be discouraged.

Mindful of this fact, the present study performed in the Dja biosphere reserve aims to assess plant diversity and carbon stocks. 10 transects of 5 ha each were assessed. 9,293 individuals divided into 47 families, 150 genera and 205 species were recorded. Euphorbiaceae was the most important family. The overall carbon stocks assessed was, 354.73 Mg C/ha. In the secondary forest the quantity of carbon stocks evaluated was 330.67&plusmn;40.07 Mg C/ha. The Raphiales and Wetlands accumulated a quantity of carbon stocks of 15.06&plusmn;0.08 and 9.00&plusmn;2.06 Mg C/ha respectively. Euphorbiaceae stored an amount of 68.38 Mg C/ha, followed by the Mimosaceae which stores the amount of 51.07 Mg C/ha and the Irvingiaceae which stores an amount of 26.07 Mg C/ha. Uapaca guineensis stored 53.60 Mg C/ha. Pentaclethra macrophylla, Petersianthus macrocarpus and Desbordesia glaucescens all stored 117.56 Mg C/ha. For an index of diversity of 3.71, secondary forest stores approximately 93% of the total carbon stock. The test of comparison carried out showed a significant difference between the carbon stocks obtained on the land cover type (LCT) (ANOVA, F = 45.76; P &lt; 0.001).</p>",

        "description": "<p>Although national parks are known for their high capacity of carbon storage and sequestration, few studies have been dedicated to determine the monetary value of this ecosystem service. Accordingly, this study aims to assign monetary values to this service in a protected area, the Lobeke National Park, located in southeast Cameroon. Flora diversity, carbon storage and sequestration in biomass of the park were assessed in 37 transects. A total of 71,725 trees, diameter at breast height &ge; 5 cm, from 76 families, 156 genera and 217 species were harvested. Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Dichostemma glaucescens, Mareyopsis longifolia, Diospyros suaveolens and Diospyros crassiflora were the most abundant taxa. Above ground biomass (AGB) was estimated at 318.04 tons ha-1 and below ground biomass (BGB) at 56.16 tons ha-1. AGB varied significantly between types of land used (p &lt; 0.001). Carbon stock varied significantly with DBH and basal area (p &lt; 0.001). The total carbon throughout the park was evaluated at 81,520,966.8 tons corresponding to over 298 million tons of CO2 sequestrated by the park. The value of the service of carbon sequestration was evaluated at 1,434,769,015.68 USD. The Lobeke National Park is designated as a carbon sink in Africa.

The present study aimed to evaluate the carbon storage and describe the structure of cashew nut plantation. Three types of cashew stand were selected according to the age of plantations; we also used savannah as a treatment witness. Carbon stocks varied according to the age of plantations; 14.51 &plusmn; 0.306 t C/ha for plantations aged 0&ndash;10 yr; 34.78 &plusmn; 0.331 t C/ha for plantations aged 10&ndash;20 yr, and 40.02 &plusmn; 0.381 t C/ha for plantations aged over 20 yr. In the witness, we found 13.05 &plusmn; 0.177 t C/ha. These values were significantly different between the studied sites (p &lt; 0.05). The mean values of the service of carbon sequestration also varied with the age of stands; $53.5/ha/yr (0&ndash;10 yr); $63.35/ha/yr (10&ndash;20 yr); $73.95/ha/yr (over 20 yr). In regard to carbon storage, $3279 are stored in these stands. These agroecosystems are also true carbon sinks. A development plan of such agroecosystems should be considered for the conservation of the species already endangered by anthropogenic activities on natural ecosystems.

        "description": "<p>Sustainable forest management in Cameroon is being plagued with many challenges directly related to key issues in the areas of forest law enforcement and governance. This study used questionnaires to examine the major community livelihood activities undertaken in the SBFR causing deforestation and forest degradation and to explore the localized trigger forces, and their implications for sustainable forest management in Cameroon. The authors found that the rated localized forces triggering indiscriminate human activities in the Southern Bakundu Forest Reserve (SBFR) are scarcity of farmland outside the forest reserve land, population growth, poverty and the more fertile nature of the forest reserve land than the limited, overused, and degraded community farming land. In addition, the authors found that forest monitoring activities in the field by forestry officials were plagued with complicity by some corrupt forestry officials, forces of law and order, administration, local management committee leaders, and disgruntled local population in the apprehension of illegal forest exploiters, besides inadequate resources. The strategies to address the above issues have not been prioritized. Based on the results, this paper argues that the governance failure to prioritize more and better investment in modern agriculture, non-wood domestic cooking energy and reliable rural transport systems, amongst others, including building institutional capacity and physical infrastructure compromises sustainable forest management in Cameroon at both the national and local community levels. In this light, a set of holistic and comprehensive strategic programmes are recommended as the way forward to guaranteeing sustainable development in forestmanagement in Cameroon.</p>",

It has been\r\nsuggested that polyploids manage harsh environments better than their diploid relatives\r\nbut empirical data supporting this hypothesis are scarce, especially for trees. Using\r\nmicrosatellite markers and flow cytometry, we examine the frequency of polyploids\r\nand diploids in a progeny trial testing four different populations of Acacia senegal, a\r\nspecies native to sub-Saharan regions of Africa.We compare growth between cytotypes\r\nand test whether polyploid seedlings grow better than diploids. Our results show that\r\npolyploids coexist with diploids in highly variable proportions among populations in\r\nSenegal. Acacia senegal genotypes were predominantly diploid and tetraploid, but\r\ntriploid, pentaploid, hexaploid, and octaploid forms were also found. We find that\r\npolyploids show faster growth than diploids under our test conditions: in an 18 years\r\nold field trial, polyploid superiority was estimated to be 17% in trunk diameter and 9% in\r\nheight while in a growth chamber experiment, polyploids grew 28% taller, but only after\r\nbeing exposed to drought stress.

        "description": "Forest assessments are essential to understand the tree population structure and diversity status of forests and to provide information for biodiversity recovery planning. Unfortunately, the majority of Miombo woodlands in Mozambique lack of inventory data, and consequently are often insufficient for management. This study aimed to assess the species richness, diversity and structure of Miombo woodlands using a range of sampling sizes in Mocuba district, Mozambique. Plant inventory was carried out in 128 systematically selected sample plots in 71.6 ha, which was divided into eight treatments, i.e., T1: 0.1 ha; T2: 0.25 ha; T3: 0.375 ha; T4: 0.5 ha; T5: 0.625 ha; T6: 0.75 ha; T7: 0.875 ha; T8: 1.0 ha, with 16 repetitions. All stems \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 10 cm diameter at breast height, and species name to evaluate the floristic composition, richness of tree species, diversity and diameter distribution were recorded. A total of 36,535 individuals were recorded, belonging 124 species, 83 genera and representing 31 botanical families. The most important species was the Brachystegia spiciformis Benth. and the richest botanical family was Fabaceae. The forest showed an average of 517 \u00c2\u00b1 85 trees/ha, and high species diversity and evenness. Analysis of covariance shows that the intercepts and slope of exponential function for diameter distribution are not significantly different for the eight treatments. Compared with the entire composite forest, inventory means were accurately estimated and size class distributions were well represented for plots \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 0.25 ha, for selecting an efficient sampling design suited to forest characteristics and the inventory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purpose.

        "description": "The success of forest creation relies on seedling availability and quality. The aim of this research is to assess the possible use of rootstock and bare-root seedlings of Cedrela fissilis obtained from natural regeneration for direct field planting. We used Generalized Linear models to assess survival and Hierarchical Models to assess height growth over one year after planting. Initial root-collar diameter (RCD) and treatment (rootstock or bare-root) affected survival and growth. Rootstock and larger seedlings presented higher levels of survival and growth. Higher seedling quality in the rootstock treatment is due to higher water stress tolerance. Rootstock seedlings with more than 1 cm of initial RCD had over 80% of survival probability, while small bare-root seedlings had mean survival probability as low as 20%. Rootstock seedlings grew as much as fourfold more than bare-root. Using natural regeneration of C. fissilis as a source of rootstock seedlings may be a cheap alternative for forest restoration and enrichment planting projects. ",

        "description": "This study was centred on the edible cola nuts (Cola acuminata and Cola nitida), often referred to as obi abata and gbanja\r\n(yoruba) in Abeokuta metropolis. The study examined economic impacts and various uses of the cola nut. Structured questionnaire\r\nwith open and close questions was distributed to120 respondents in the study area. Markets were selected from three Local\r\ngovernment areas namely Lafenwa, Kuto, Iberekodo and Ishiun at Owode Egba purposively. The markets are local markets where\r\nfarm produce are being sold in the study area. Descriptive statistics, cost and return analysis was used to analyze the data obtained\r\nfrom the study. The result obtained shows that 88.33% of the respondents were female who engage in the trade, 52.50% were in age\r\ngroup above 45 years which was the largest and were Yoruba. 51.87% had no formal education and are mostly full-time sellers. The\r\nresult also revealed that traditionally 81.67% uses the nut for wedding and 97.50% for dye. The cost analysis reveals the average\r\nprofit for each market, at Ishiun N3 293.375, Lafenwa N8 702.83, Kuto N4 869.40, and Iberekodo N3 127.20 and the rate of return\r\non investment were at Ishiun 33.24%, Lafenwa 35.96%, Kuto 33.17%, Iberekodo 26.54% , respectively. It shows that Lafenwa has\r\nthe highest rate of returns on investment and profit. The result also showed that the mean value of profit and return on investment for\r\nall the market were N4 998.21 and 32.23% respectively, this was due to the level of organisation in transaction in the market. The\r\nresult also reveals the market margin per market at Ishiun 24.95%, Lafenwa 26.45%, Kuto 24.95%, and Iberekodo 21.00%\r\nrespectively with the mean margin for all the market at 24.33%. The major problem encountered in business was basically that of\r\nstorage with insect infestation at 53.33% and heat 51.67% which reduces the value and invariably the price of the product. Hence, a\r\ngood storage system is important to improve sales. Hence a good policy must be put in place for good storage system to improve\r\nquality during storage and enhance income of respondents.\r\nKeywords Socio-economic; Cola marketing; Rural women; Livelihood",

        "description": "<p>ABSTRACT This study estimates the optimal rotation period of various tree species in Kenya and applies it in the management of lumbering forests through optimal synchronization of forest plantations to achieve a steady supply to lumbering firms. The optimal rotation period of three tree species, pine, cypress, and eucalyptus, was estimated using data from Kenya Forest Service. A combined application of Chang simple production model and \u00e2\u20ac\u2039 Faustmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2039 model\u00e2\u20ac\u2039 reveals the optimal biological harvest age is 25 years for pine, 25 years for cypress, and 14 years for eucalyptus. However, introducing the prices and using the Faustmann optimal rotation model at the current market interest rate of 10.5%, the Faustmann rotation age for pine stand will be maximized at 12.67 years, cypress at 23.5 years, and eucalyptus at 38.4 years. The research further indicates significant variability in land expectation value and soil rent of various species and proposes an inclusion of &ldquo;species&rdquo; as a variable in forest land valuation. In the conclusion, nonmarket factors affecting the optimal yield were further explained and recommendations on sustainable yield production were suggested.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10549811.2018.1447488\">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10549811.2018.1447488</a></p>",

        "description": "<p>This study compared the phytoecological characteristics of some protected areas [Strict<br />nature reserve (SNR), Oluwa natural forest (ONF) and permanent sample plot 29 aimed at<br />biodiversity conservation and a degraded forest not under reservation] in the lowland humid forest,Ondo state, Nigeria. Data were collected using Systematic Line Transect method with two paralleltransects of 200 m apart for plot location. Four sample plots (25 m &times; 25 m) were laid alternately oneach transect in each of the forests. In each plot, trees with DBH &ge; 10 cm were measured(diameters at the base, middle, top and total height), identified and classified into families and frequency of occurrence to ascertain the present status of the protected areas in term of tree diversity, abundance and yield. A total of 411 stems.ha-1 from 78 species and 30 families was recorded in the study sites. Celtis zenkeri, Cola gigantea and Funtumia elastica were common to all the forests. The DBH distribution curve of the species followed inverse J-shaped pattern with 49.4% of trees falling within the lowest diameter class (10&ndash;20 cm) while only 7.14% falls in the highest diameter class (&gt;80 cm). SNR and ONF have emergent trees whose heights were above 30m (18.7% and 7.02% of the total number of trees in the Sterculaceae and Meliaceae families, respectively) whereas 14.90 m was the highest height recorded in the free forest. On biovolume yield, ONF has the highest volume per hectare (141.06 m3) while the least (14.56 m3) was from the forest not under reservation. The Shannon-Weiner index, Pielou&rsquo;s Evenness index and Margalef&#39;s index for all the forest reserves are 5.11, 0.69 and 12.79 respectively with the highest for ONF. These indices indicated that the protected areas are mature and foster in-situ conservation of tree species especially the keystone species.</p>",

        "description": "Teratosphaeria stem canker is one of the most important diseases to have emerged on non-native plantation-grown Eucalyptus trees globally. In 2012, Eucalyptus grandis trees with typical Teratosphaeria stem canker symptoms were observed in Uganda. Multigene sequence analyses of isolates from these cankers led to the identification of T. gauchensis, previously recorded in Uganda, and T. zuluensis. This study represents the first report of T. zuluensis in Uganda. Furthermore, this is the first report of the co-occurrence of T. zuluensis and T. gauchensis in a single area.",

        "description": "Teratosphaeria gauchensis (Capnodiales) causes a serious stem canker disease on commercially propagated Eucalyptus species in South America. Recently, this pathogen was detected for the first time in Africa. Very little is known regarding the biology or origin of T. gauchensis, but it has been suggested that it is native to South America. The aim of this study was to compare isolates from Africa and South America using microsatellite markers. Bayesian analysis conducted in STRUCTURE, principal coordinates analysis and a UPGMA dendrogram revealed two distinct genetic groups for these isolates. The South American isolates were more genetically diverse than those from Africa. Patterns of genetic diversity in Africa suggest that T. gauchensis could have been introduced into Zimbabwe before spreading north-eastwards. The existence of the two genetic groups and high haplotype richness associated with the South American and Zimbabwean populations suggest that it will be more difficult to reduce the impact of disease caused by T. gauchensis in these regions than in those areas where there is limited genetic diversity.",

        "description": "The Eucalyptus stem canker pathogen Teratosphaeria zuluensis was discovered in South\r\nAfrica in 1988 and it has subsequently been found in several other African countries as well as globally. In this study, the population structure, genetic diversity and evolutionary history of T. zuluensis were analysed using microsatellite markers to gain an enhanced\r\nunderstanding of its movement in Africa. Isolates were collected from several sites in Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia. Data obtained were compared with those previously published for a South African population. The data obtained from 334 isolates,\r\namplified across eight microsatellite loci, were used for assignment, differentiation and genetic diversity tests. STRUCTURE analyses, hst and genetic distances revealed the existence of two clusters, one dominated by isolates from South Africa and the other\r\nby isolates from the Zambezi basin including Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. High levels of admixture were found within and among populations, dominated by the Mulanje population in Malawi. Moderate to low genetic diversity of the populations supports the\r\npreviously held view that the pathogen was introduced into Africa. The clonal nature of the Ugandan population suggests a very recent introduction, most likely from southern Africa.",

        "description": "The global spread of Eucalyptus pathogens is thought to be facilitated by the trade in seed for the establishment of new plantations and breeding programmes. In this study, we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to elucidate whether this might be true for the Eucalyptus stem pathogen Teratosphaeria zuluensis in South Africa. DNA libraries were obtained for seed-capsules, clean seed, 1-month-old seedlings grown in a phytotron, plants grown in vitro in a tissue culture facility as well as leaves and stems of 3-month-old seedlings exposed to a Eucalyptus plantation environment. The DNA libraries were sequenced using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq and 454 technologies. Sequencing revealed the presence of several OTUs in the Botryosphaeriaceae, Mycosphaerellaceae\r\nand Teratosphaeriaceae in seed and seed-capsules and amongst these, OTUs that cluster close to T. zuluensis. OTUs from the Mycosphaerellaceae were also recovered from seedlings grown in a phytotron, in vitro propagated seedlings and those exposed to the plantation environment. The results support the view that important Eucalyptus\r\npathogens, including T. zuluensis, can be spread via the trade in seed.",

        "title": "Diseases of Eucalyptus species in Zimbabwean plantations and woodlots",
        "description": "Zimbabwe embarked on planting Eucalyptus species in the early 1900s. Based on a robust breeding programme, it has become a major source of seed for other countries in and outside Africa. Tree health surveys conducted on Eucalyptus in some east and southern African countries over the past two decades have revealed several important\r\nfungal diseases that were previously not known in the region, but little is known regarding these problems in Zimbabwe. The aim of this study was to identify important Eucalyptus diseases across Zimbabwe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agroclimatic regions. Morphological characteristics and DNA sequence data were used to identify pathogens collected to species level. Widespread stem canker diseases, caused by species belonging to the Botryosphaeriaceae and\r\nTeratosphaeriaceae, and leaf spot diseases caused by fungi in the Capnodiales, were identified. Armillaria root and stem rot was restricted to a single site in the Eastern Highlands. Fungi that could cause canker or blue stain of timber were isolated from recently harvested stumps and included species of Ceratocystis and Ophiostoma. This\r\nstudy is the first to identify Eucalyptus pathogens to species level in Zimbabwe and we report for the first time the presence of the stem canker pathogen T. gauchensis in southern Africa. The results will provide a foundation for the formulation of future disease management strategies in the country ",

        "description": "The role of forests in mitigating the effect of climate change depends on the carbon sequestration potential and management. This study was conducted to estimate the carbon stock and its variation along environmental gradients in Arba Minch Ground Water Forest. The data was collected from the field by measuring plants with a DBH of >5cm in quadrat plots of 10 X 20 m and the carbon stocks of each plant were analyzed by using allometric equations. From this study the mean total carbon stock density of Arba Minch Ground Water Forest was found to be 583.27 t ha-1, of which 829.12 t ha-1, 165.88 t ha-1, 1.28 t ha-1, 83.80 t ha-1 was contained in the above ground carbon, belowground carbon, litter carbon and soil organic carbon (0-30 cm depth) 0respectively. Similarly, the analysis of carbon stock variation of different carbon pools on eight different aspects of the forest area showed a significant variation with the exception of litter carbon stock and this is due to fast decomposition rate of litters and low amount of litter fall in the forest. The amount of carbon stock in above and belowground biomass, soil organic carbon and the total carbon stock was higher on the southern aspect as compared to other aspects. This study concluded that the carbon stock value of Arba Minch Ground Water Forest is large, and this will serve as a potential entry point for the engagement of the forest in REDD project.",

        "title": "Structural Analysis and Woody Plant Species Composition of Arba Minch Riverine Forest, Southern Ethiopia",
        "description": "The study was conducted in Arba Minch riverine forest with the objective of determining woody plant species diversity of the forest. Sampling plots were laid along line transects on plant community type based on dominance or co-dominance. A total of 70 plots with 10 m \u00c3\u2014 20 m distributed along transect lines was established to take woody plant samples. Structural analysis was performed on the basis of density, frequency, diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area per hectare. The distribution of the size classes were evaluated by computing the density of individuals with diameter at breast height >10 cm and > 20 cm as well as the ratio of the former to the latter. The result revealed that a total of 30 different woody species were recorded in the Arba Minch riverine forest of which Lecaniodiscus fraxinifolius and Diospyrosa byssinica were the dominant species with recorded value of 506 and 490 stems, respectively. Euclea divonorum, Maytenus senegalensis and Ficus sycomorus covered 358, 138 and 105, respectively. Terminalia brownii, Ziziphus mucronata and Acacia tortilis were the least dominant species with equal coverage of one in the study forest. Based on their higher important value index, Tamarindus indica, Ficus sycomorus,Garcinia livingstonia, Maerua aethiopica, Maytenus senegalensis and Euclea divonorum, respectively were the leading dominants. The density of woody plant in study area decreased with increasing of DBH and height classes, which implies the\r\npredominance of small sized individuals in the lower classes than that of higher classes implyinggood recruitment of the forest and the rare occurrence of large woody plant species.",

        "title": "Sengwer Community and their Dependency on Kapolet Forest Resources of Cherangani Hills, Kenya",
        "description": "Forests are of great significance to the local people especially in the rural areas. Majority of\r\nKenyans depend on forest resources for their livelihood, particularly for fuel wood, timber,\r\nNon-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) and other ecological functions. Sengwer is one of the\r\nindigenous communities predominantly found on the slopes of Cherangani hills, Kenya. The\r\nobjective of this paper was to document the benefits and types of forest resources accessed\r\nby the forest community in Kapolet forest. Data was collected by administration of\r\nquestionnaires to the household heads in the study area with a sample size 112 households\r\nfrom an accessible population of 1,126 individuals. Field observations and interview with a\r\ntotal of 16 key informants was also used in data collection with the key informants being\r\nselected based on their experience and knowledge on forest resources utilization.\r\nDescriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis using Statistical Package for\r\nthe Social Sciences (SPSS version 17). The findings show that 96.4 % of Sengwer\r\ncommunity living adjacent to Kapolet forest depends on the forest resources for their\r\nlivelihoods. The major product harvested from the forest was fuel wood as 76.4 % of the\r\ncommunity members indicated they obtained firewood from forest. Other products included\r\nhoney, herbs used for medicine, water, building poles, charcoal, bush meat and pasture for\r\nlivestock grazing. There was a significant relationship between household income and\r\ncharcoal production (P=0.00, \u00cf\u20212 =19.702) and between household income and harvesting of\r\nbuilding poles (P=0.017, \u00cf\u20212 =8.200). The findings also indicate that the Sengwer are still\r\ndependent on the forest for survival despite 59. 8 % of the community members shifting\r\nfrom their traditional hunting and gathering to agriculture and livestock keeping. Therefore,\r\nalternative sources of livelihoods should be provided to the community to ease the pressure\r\non the forest resources.",

        "description": "Protected areas in Kenya constitute 7% of the total land area with over 75% of wildlife in the country being found on private or communal land. Rural communities in Kenya, where protected areas generally exist, face a range of development issues with limited resources and livelihood opportunities. In this context, community-based biodiversity conservation has the potential to promote ecotourism opportunities which can reconcile and sustain economic development with biodiversity conservation and sharing the costs and benefits of conservation. This study examined biodiversity conservation and ecotourism issues using the case study of the Kimana Community Wildlife Sanctuary which is communally managed protected area. The research explored the socio-economic profile of locals residing in close proximity to the protected area. Economic and livelihood activities (with a focus on those that are ecotourism-related) were looked at together with other perceived benefits associated with the protected area and ecotourism. Levels of understanding of key environmental concepts (biodiversity, conservation and ecotourism) were also considered. Additionally, perceptions and attitudes towards biodiversity conservation and ecotourism in the area were assessed. A total of 100 households were interviewed. The main findings were that there was considerable support for biodiversity conservation and ecotourism among the respondents, although concerns were raised in relation to both complementary activities. There was, however, limited understanding of key environmental concepts. Key benefits were associated with employment opportunities (including tourism-related businesses), service and infrastructural development, and support for local community development projects.",

        "description": "The conversion of forests into other land uses as well as unsustainable utilization of forest resources leads to a reduction in the area, quality and quantity of the forest cover and ecosystem services. Changes in forest cover as a result of the resource strain imposed on the ecosystem can significantly affect the local climate in terms of temperature and rainfall. This study was carried out to assess the drivers of forest cover change in Katimok forest and the impacts that the changes have had on the local climate in terms of temperature and rainfall. Household questionnaires, field observations and focus group discussions were used to identify the drivers of forest cover and to assess the perceptions of the community on whether there had been changes in forest cover and local climate since 1985. Climatic data was obtained from Katimok meteorological station. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the social data and climatic data. The results indicated that agriculture and logging were perceived as the major drivers of forest cover change. The results from the climate data shows a slight increase in temperature trend from 1985-2012 with mean annual temperature range of +-1.44561. Similarly, the rainfall data shows an increasing trend, though not significantly. The study indicates that the observed forest degradation is as a result of observed anthropogenic activities in and around the forest. Therefore, there is need to develop stringent policy measures and appropriate strategies that can alter this unfavorable situation and lead to conservation of this ecosystem.",

        "description": "Increased human population pressure and climate change constitute the global underlying root causes of accelerated and devastating land degradation processes in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs). River Loboi watershed, located at the lower part of the Lake Baringo Catchment, is not an exception. The area is characterized by severe vegetation degradation that has resulted in extreme soil deterioration. This study aimed to determine the extent of land degradation in the watershed with specific objectives of determining the vegetation cover and composition, observing signs of accelerated soil erosion as well as assessing the socio-economic status of the inhabitants in the watershed. Tools for data collection included structured questionnaire, observation schedules and oral histories. The measured variables were analysed using a one-way ANOVA (\u00ce\u00b1 =0.05) and correlation analysis. The results indicated that the whole watershed is degraded with 87.5% of the watershed being highly degraded and the remaining 12.5% moderately degraded. The\r\noverall vegetation cover was 59.6%. The middle section (Simotwe location) was the worst hit and recorded the least vegetation cover of 51.4%. In addition the watershed indicated signs of transformation towards a shrubland. The results demonstrate the urgency of developing and establishing more effective and scientific ways to curb and monitor land degradation processes in the watershed.",

        "description": " information regarding the hunting activities of local residents is essential for solving sustainability problems in afro-tropical forests. We studied bushmeat hunting in two Community hunting Zones (ChZs 13 and 14) located in the northern periphery of Boumba-Bek national park in southeastern Cameroon. We monitored 899.14 hunter-days in nine neighboring villages, over a period of 12 months. animals were hunted in national parks and in logging and agroforestry zones. We recorded 587 carcasses of 38 species, for a total fresh biomass of 3.46 tons. ungulates and primates were the most heavily hunted; however, the latter were primarily represented in ChZ 13, the zone with the most intensive hunting pressure. reptiles and birds were fairly represented among offtakes (4.36%). harvests varied considerably by species and ChZ. the blue duiker (41%) and the putty-nosed monkey (15%) were the most frequently captured. in contrast with the latter, the blue duiker was harvested at similar rates in all the villages, indicating its importance for local people. hunters consumed 26.7% of their total catch with their families and sold 67.8%. the bushmeat trade, defined in terms of the proportion of animals sold, was positively correlated with the number of households. in both ChZs hunting was largely unsustainable for blue duikers. however, in ChZ 14 offtakes of red duikers were probably under sustainable harvest limit. our analysis have implications for the development of adaptive wildlife management plans that could enhance sustainability in the region. overhunting will not be solved, unless the bushmeat trade is tackled effectively.",

        "description": "Background \r\n Wild edible plants are crucial resources with multiple uses and services. Some of them \r\nare most preferred by people. Indigenous people have vast ethnobotanocal knowledge of \r\nthe use and management of these resources. Ximenia americana is among most preferred \r\nmultiuse use wild edible plants. It is under threat by over harvesting and climate change. \r\nConserving its use and associated indigenous knowledge is essential. Taking \r\nconservation actions should be based on research data among which ethnobotanical \r\nstudies are essential for rehabilitation and to manage the species and associated \r\nindigenous knowledge. \r\nMethods \r\nEthnobotanical and socioeconomic studies were conducted from October, 2009 through \r\nApril, 2010 to analyse uses and abundance of Ximenia americana at six study sites from \r\nFantalle (Galcha, Qobbo, Dheebiti) and Boosat (Xadacha, Trii Bireti and Diglau Tiyo) in \r\nEthiopia. The main data collection methods used constituted, field inspection by guided \r\nwalks, focus group discussions with 14  key informants taken from transhumant and \r\nsettled framers of the two districts  and systematic field observations along six transects. \r\nThe information gathered was further cross checked by discussing with local residents to \r\nverify community knowledge.  \r\nResults \r\nThe result revealed that, the indigenous people have vast knowledge of use and \r\nmanagement of X.americana. It is a multipurpose species used for fuel, fodder, making \r\nhousehold utensils and for charcoal production. However, overexploitation has \r\ndeciminated the species and specimens are rarely seen in the present vegetation of east \r\nShewa. Two decades back, the species was abundant near homes, road sides, farm \r\nborders, nearby woodlands and forests. The roots and other pats of the species are used \r\nfor medicine and its fruit is served as food and source of income. However, because of \r\noverexploitation, the species is about to be extinct. The species is about to be forgotten \r\nby the people being rare for users falling under IUCN category of locally threatened \r\nspecies.  This has threatened the indigenous knowledge associated with the use and \r\nmanagement of the species.   \r\n Conclusion: \r\n Natural regeneration of X.americana is rare calling for urgent rehabilitation by closure \r\nof the natural habitat being complemented with its cultivation and subsequent \r\ndomestication for sustainable utilization. Further research on its abundance in other \r\nhabitats, agronomic aspects and popularization of the uses is recommended. ",

        "description": "<p>Twenty years after the promulgation of the Forest, Wildlife and Fishery Law 94/01 of 20 January 1994 in which the implication of local communities in the management and conservation of natural resources constituted a great innovation, community forestry in Cameroon is still characterized by wild sawing with severe consequences on forest cover and lack of income for local populations. One of the major reasons is the insuf\u00ef\u00ac\u0081 cient \u00ef\u00ac\u0081 nancial and technical capacities to satisfy current regulations, resulting in the promotion of illegal activities and high corruption throughout the process of attributing, managing and exploiting Community Forests (CF). In order to propose a Wood Tracking System applicable to CF in Cameroon based on the National Tracking System developed by the STBC Project1, a study was undertaken in 2012 in a community forest in South Cameroon and funded by the SNV/PELFC2 project. We interviewed resource persons working with NGO, CF and local communities, in order to evaluate their perception on the feasibility of this tracking system. Results revealed that among the 60 interviewed community members, 90% are not aware of its existence; 70 to 80% of the legal documents required to track timber are not available in the visited CF; even when NGO are supporting the process within a community, the success is not guaranteed and the durability of their actions remains questionable. Staying within current mood and based on problems mentioned above, we are promoting a basic documentary tracking system where forest inventories, geo referencing of trees and the establishment of Annual Certi\u00ef\u00ac\u0081 cate of Exploitation (ACE) are cancelled. We propose that an annual quota (in m3 of wood per species) and a minimum exploitable diameter per species, based on scienti\u00ef\u00ac\u0081 c researches in each forest zone in Cameroon (Centre, South, Southwest, Southeast, East), should be imposed on CF in order to ensure a sustainable management of the resources. We also propose the decentralization of administrative procedures that should be fully accomplished at the sub divisional level. Even for such a basic timber tracking system, the total engagement of the forest administration and the law enforcement are the pre-requisites. For example, is it necessary for the elaboration of a &lsquo;simple management plan&rsquo; to do forest management inventory, particularly knowing that the CF is located in the non-permanent forest domain? Is it feasible to ask to a community, who does not have the technical capacity and have no means, to recruit a consultant up to the task? Is it necessary to issue an ACE that is based on fake forest inventory results? In other words, the current requirements of community forestry in Cameroon looks like &lsquo;asking a \u00ef\u00ac\u0081 ve years old child grown in a Cameroon rural environment to do advanced mathematics!&rsquo; With the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) &ndash; Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) signed between Cameroon and the EU, all timber and timber products from Cameroon have to ful\u00ef\u00ac\u0081 ll all the legal requirements. This means that the CF timbers are at risk to be out of the process. Why not shape regulations that are basic and based on what local communities are capable of doing with few innovations and less additional costs? Is it not advisable to revise a law even if it will result in &lsquo;downgrading&rsquo; it for the promotion of its respect and maximum application by local communities and the forestry administration? We are convinced that by doing so the community forestry will contribute effectively to poverty reduction and to sustainable management of natural resources in rural areas.</p>",

        "description": "Primary users of wildlife have only rarely been considered in determining the status of threatened species. There is no recent information on the status of Piliocolobus preussi (Critically Endangered) and Cercocebus torquatus (Vulnerable) in southwestern Cameroon. This study documents the status of both primates using data collected in Korup National Park (KNP), Banyang-Mbo Wildlife Sanctuary (BMWS), and Nkwende-Hills (NHFR), Nta-Ali (NAFR) and Rumpi-Hills (RHFR) forest reserves, referred to as the Korup region (KR). The study area is an important portion of both species\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ranges in the West Africa Biodiversity Hotspot. We were specifically interested in confirming the presence/absence of each species per site, identifying threats, evaluating trends in abundance and, using the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification categories and criteria in assessing the conservation status for both species. We interviewed 178 hunters from 31 peripheral villages, and collected data on 286.9 km of recce walks in the Korup region. Statistical comparisons of mean perceptions of hunters showed P. preussi to be significantly present in KNP (88.9%), but not in NHFR (65.6%) and BMWS (57.7%), and C. torquatus to be significantly present in NHFR (100%) and BMWS (96.7%), but not in KNP (77.8%). According to 54.9% and 53.9% of the hunters interviewed, poaching is the main threat to the respective species. Habitat loss is also important. Data from the last ten years shows a proportional decline in relative abundance of 83.4% and 53.4% for P. preussi and C. torquatus, respectively. We suspect a decline in the extent of occurrence and/or habitat quality in the Korup Region. In order to ensure awareness of the needs for their conservation, we recommend that C. torquatus be classified as Endangered (A2bc), and P. preussi be maintained as Critically Endangered (A2bc) because of the estimated declines of  \u00e2\u2030\u00a550% and 80%, respectively, based on encounter rate, and suspected decline in the extent of occurrence and habitat quality.",

        "description": "Background: Garcinia kola is an indigenous multipurpose tree species commonly found in the tropical rain forest zone of West and Central Africa. Providing economic, ecological, and socio-cultural benefits for people, they have potentials to improve the regional and local income generation to the farmers but the cultivation of the species is very limited in Nigeria. Methods: The study investigated cultivation and farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perceptions on the impacts of climate change on goods and services provided by G. kola in Nigeria. Structured questioners and interviews were used. The data obtained was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistic such as frequency, percentage, chi-square, and multinomial logit regressions with SPSS Version 20 and R software Version 3.1.0. Results: The results show that farmers are presently not cultivating G. kola, and most of the available stands were inherited from grandparents. The farmers still believe it is only God that can make G. kola to germinate; however, information about the new improved methods of raising G. kola was not spread across farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 communities. Over 93% of these farmers were not aware of these new methods, and the only means they raise the species is by picking the wildlings that regenerate naturally close to mother tree and are rarely found. The finding also shows that farmers are well aware of climate change and its impact on crop productivity is not clear to them. The result shows that five explanatory variables (age, gender, marital status, education level, household size and primary occupation) are the main factors significantly influencing farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 perception of climate change and the cultivation of the G. kola. During interview section, the farmers reported variability of Harmattan season influences fruit production of the species; according to them, increase in Harmattan season usually leads to increase in fruiting of G. kola. Conclusions: Based on our findings, all the 215 respondent interviewed agree that climatic variability influences the availability of G. kola which will in turn have significant effects on the goods and services provided to the people.

        "description": "Abstract Niger republic, a Sahelian country with about 75 % of its area covered by\r\nthe Sahara desert, continues to face high land degradation due to human activities and\r\nclimate change. This land degradation, which is mainly manifested in the forms of\r\nsoil crusts, gullies, sand dunes, siltation of water bodies such as River Niger, Lake\r\nChad, and many other inland lakes, has many consequences including loss of\r\nproductivity and biodiversity that lead to desertification and poverty. To reverse the\r\ntrend of land degradation, Niger Republic, with the support of its partners, has\r\nundertaken many actions on land restoration. These have helped to rehabilitate\r\nmore than 250,000 ha of degraded land and develop local knowledge and skills\r\nthat can be used worldwide. Sustainable land management practices and agroforestry\r\ntechniques used in Niger to rehabilitate these degraded lands include tree planting\r\n(shelter belt, living fence, urban planting) and construction of anti-erosive infrastructures\r\nusing soil and water conservation techniques such as: rock dikes, half-moon,\r\nstabilization of gullies and river banks, sand dunes stabilization, and protection and\r\npromotion of natural regeneration. Benefits derived from these techniques include\r\nreduction of wind and water erosion, production of fuel wood and fodder, increased\r\nsoil fertility, food security and carbon sequestration, recovery of wild species,\r\nimprovement of local population revenues and livelihood, and local knowledge and\r\nskills in land restoration.",

Data were analyzed with R (Software) using Kruskal Wallis test and four groups of farms were identified of which the big farmers holding medium herd, medium farmers holding small herd, big livestock farmers using small land and small farmer/livestock keepers. The criteria taken into account are the cultivated area, productions and incomes, food blanket; number of animals raised and land acquisition. It appears that the big farmers holding medium herd contrary to three other groups have good productions and incomes to ensure food self-sufficiency. The group of big livestock farmers using small land has largest herd (25.7 TLU) and therefore exerts strong pastoral pressure (32.8 tons of dry matter) on forestry resources. The four groups of farmers harvest annually 2.6 to 3 tons of wood",

        "description": "The aim of this study was to analyze determinants of women adaptation to potential impacts of climate change. Multinomial logit model was fitted to the data from survey of 150 (one hundred fifty) women headed households. The study was conducted in Benshangul Regional State of Ethiopia,Assosa District from January to June 2015. Women perception on climate was assessed using indicators of climate change .The major climate change adaptation measures women practice in the study area were identified and selected by focus group discussion. The different factors affecting the choice of the practices were identified from literature review and researcher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge of the contextual setting. Women headed households were purposively selected from the rural area of the district and 150 (one hundred fifty) sample households were randomly selected. Semi-structured questionnaire was administered and the survey was fitted to Multinomial logit model using stata software. The result of the analysis showed that women perceived the presence of climate change very well. Moreover, wealth status, access to climate change information, average distance from home of rivers and forest, education level, access and control over resources, working condition (length of working hour per day) and, area of land owned were the determinants of climate change adaptations. So, poverty, lack of access to climate information,lack of access to education, lack of agricultural extension service, lack of access and control over\r\nresources, long distance women walk to fetch water and fuel, and long working hour conditions were barriers of women climate change adaptation decision. Economical empowering of women,improving access of women to climate information, construction of water schemes near houses, promotion of use of energy saving cook stoves, improving women access and control over resources and minimizing work load by changing women working condition are suggested interventions to increase women climate change adaptive capacity.",

Current rainfall data was collected from Hawassa national meteorology agency. Depending on the quality of the data seven meteorological stations were selected. Projected rainfall was downloaded. Rainfall variability analysis has been done using variability indices like, coefficient of variation (CV), precipitation concentration index (PCI) and Standard anomaly index (SAI).Trend analysis was carried out using Man-Kendall trend test at 1, 5 and 10% significance levels. Rainfall variability showed that high monthly and seasonal rainfall variability, while annual rainfall showed low variability. Analysis of rainfall distribution indicated moderate annual and low to moderate seasonal rainfall distribution. During the period of study moderate and severe extreme droughts occurred. The results suggest the need for designing appropriate adaptation strategies to offset the negative impacts of high monthly and seasonal rainfall variability.",

        "description": "Accurate biomass estimation is critical to quantify the changes in biomass and carbon stocks following the restoration of degraded landscapes.However, there is lack of site-specific allometric equations for the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), which consequently limits our understanding of the contributions of restoration efforts inmitigating climate change. This study was conducted in northwestern Ethiopia to develop amulti-species allometric equation and investigate the spatial and temporal variation of C-stocks following the restoration of degraded landscapes.We harvested and weighed 84 trees fromeleven dominant species fromsix grazing exclosures and adjacent communal grazing land.We observed that AGB correlates significantly with diameter at\r\nstump height D30 (R2 =0.78; P<0.01), and tree heightH(R2 =0.41, P<0.05). Our bestmodel, which includes D30 andH as predictors explained 82% of the variations in AGB. This model produced the lowest bias with narrow ranges of errors across different diameter classes. Estimated\r\nC-stock showed a significant positive correlation with stemdensity (R2 =0.80, P<0.01) and basal area (R2 =0.84, P<0.01). At the watershed level, themean C-stock was 3.8 (\u00c2\u00b10.5) MgCha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191. Plot-level C-stocks varied between 0.1 and 13.7MgCha\u00e2\u02c6\u20191. Estimated C-stocks in three- and seven-year-old exclosures exceeded estimated C-stock in the communal grazing land by 50%. The species that contributemost to C-stocks were Leucaena sp. (28%), Calpurnia aurea (21%), Euclea racemosa (20.9%), and Dodonaea angustifolia (15.8%). The equations developed in this study allow monitoring changes in C-stocks and C-sequestration following the implementation of restoration practices in northern Ethiopia over space and time. The estimated C-stocks can be used as a reference against which future changes in C-stocks can be compared.",

        "description": "Forests provide fundamental ecosystem services. Environmental changes are predicted to affect forest growth directly through increased environmental stressors, and indirectly by amplifying disturbance. To increase our understanding of effects of environmental changes and disturbance on Afromontane forest growth, we used tree- ring data collected from Juniperus procera trees from church forests in the northwest highlands of Ethiopia. We used structural change models to detect structural shift in growth trends. We applied Linear Mixed Effect Models (LMM) to compare growth rate differences between successive tree generations. The running mean method and radial growth pattern analysis were used to detect disturbance events. Three groups of generations were iden-\r\ntified based on Basal Area Increment (BAI) rates. There are significant differences (\u00cf\u20212=204.64, P < .001) among generations in pace of BAI, indicating that old generation trees grew at a slower pace than younger ones. Radial growth patterns were homogeneous for the old generation, but diverse in young trees. The observed high growth rates in the younger generation may have a negative effect on the longevity of the individuals and positively affect carbon accumulation in the biomass. Disturbance was detected in all generations, but worsened in the 20th century. About 35% of disturbances matched with climate extreme events, providing evidence that the disturbance is both human-induced (i.e., site-specific) and climate-induced. Thus, forest management plans should emerge from a sound understanding of climate-forest-human interaction.",

        "title": "Tree dieback affects climate change mitigation potential of a dry afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia",
        "description": "Extreme climatic events such as droughts are likely to result in huge and long-lasting effects on regional ecosystem health if large numbers of foundation tree species continue to die. Although deforestation is severe in the Ethiopian highlands, some remnants of dry afromontane forests still exist. However, the resilience of these forests under climate change scenarios is unknown. Therefore, we studied (1) the extent and spatial patterns of standing dead stems along an elevational gradient and (2) the effects of die- back on forest carbon sequestration potential and aboveground carbon stocks, in Juniperus procera and Olea europaea dominated dry afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia, using allometric models combined with tree ring analysis. Juniperus procera and Olea europaea constitute 67% of the total tree population. Tree dieback affected a quarter of the total population. This loss is critical because 92.2% of snags belong to J. procera and O. europaea, which are the foundation species of the study forest. The total estimated mean aboveground C-stock was 19.3 (\u00c2\u00b13.9) Mg C ha?1. Of this estimate, snags contributed 34.5% of total C-stock. The estimated annual C-sequestration potential of the study forest was 0.33 (\u00c2\u00b10.03) Mg C ha?1 year?1, which is 27% less when compared to the pre-tree dieback C-sequestration potential. We found a decreasing trend in tree dieback with increasing elevation, which implies that the aboveground C-stocks and climate change mitigation potentials of the forest, was highly affected at lower elevations which is the drier part of the landscape. Tree ring analysis showed that trees reach medium-sized stem diameter (i.e., 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c25 cm) after no less than 100 years, indicating that the effect of forest dieback on C-sequestration potential and ecosystem function is long-lasting. Our results provide information on the magnitude of tree dieback and its long-lasting impact on forest carbon fluxes and forest ecosystem services. Evidently, the results substantiate the importance of protecting such forest to maintain the quality of the environ- ment and to reduce efforts and cost for forest restoration after major loss. Finally, the information gained by this study provides baseline information for comparison of future carbon sequestration estimates.",

        "title": "The frankincense tree Boswellia neglecta reveals high potential for restoration of woodlands in the Horn of Africa",
        "description": "Boswellia neglecta S. Moore is a frankincense-producing tree species dominantly found in the dry wood- lands of southeastern Ethiopia. Currently, the population of this socio-economically and ecologically important species is threatened by complex anthropogenic and climate change related factors. Evaluation of tree age and its radial growth dynamics in relation to climate variables helps to understand the response of the species to climate change. It is also crucial for sustainable forest resource manage- ment and utilization. Dendrochronological and remote-sensing techniques were used to study periodicity of wood formation and leaf phenology and to assess the growth dynamics of B. neglecta. The results show that B. neglecta forms two growth rings per year in the study area. The growth ring structure is charac- terized by larger vessels at the beginning of each growing season and smaller vessels formed later in the growing season, suggesting adaptation to decreasing soil moisture deficits at the end of the growing sea- son. Seasonality in cambial activity matches with a bimodal leaf phenological pattern. The mean annual radial growth rate of B. neglecta trees is 2.5 mm. Tree age varied between 16 and 28 years, with an aver- age age of 22 years. The young age of these trees indicates recent colonization of B. neglecta in the study region. The growth rate and seasonal canopy greenness (expressed by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index \u00e2\u20ac\u201c NDVI) were positively correlated with rainfall, suggesting that rainfall is the main climatic factor controlling growth of B. neglecta. The observed temporal changes in leaf phenology and vessel size across the growth rings indicate that the species is drought tolerant. Therefore, it can be regarded as a key tree species for restoration of moisture-related limited areas across the Horn of Africa.",

Reconstructed rainfall since A.D. 1811 revealed significant interannual variations between 2.2 and 3.8 year periodicity, with significant decadal and multidecadal variations during 1855\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1900 and 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1990. The duration of negative and positive rainfall anomalies varied between 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 years and 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8 years. Approximately 78.4% (95%) of reconstructed dry (extreme dry) and 85.4% (95%) of wet (extreme wet) events lasted for 1 year only and corresponded to historical records of famine and flooding, suggesting that future climate change studies should be both trend and extreme event focused. The average return periods for dry (extreme dry) and wet (extreme wet) events were 4.1 (8.8) years and 4.1 (9.5) years. Extreme\u00e2\u20ac\u0090dry conditions during the 19th century were concurrent with drought episodes in equatorial eastern Africa that occurred at the end of the Little Ice Age. El Ni\u00c3\u00b1o and La Ni\u00c3\u00b1a events matched with 38.5% and 50% of extreme\u00e2\u20ac\u0090dry and extreme\u00e2\u20ac\u0090wet events. Equivalent matches for positive and negative Indian Ocean Dipole events were weaker, reaching 23.1 and 25%, respectively. Spatial correlations revealed that reconstructed rainfall represents wet\u00e2\u20ac\u0090season rainfall variations over northern Ethiopia and large parts of the Sahel belt. The data presented are useful for backcasting climate and hydrological models and for developing regional strategic plans to manage scarce and contested water resources. Historical perspectives on long\u00e2\u20ac\u0090term regional rainfall variability improve the interpretation of recent climate trends.",

Though, its measurement remains a challenge in forest inventory task. The ability to predict crown diameter from stump diameter provides an effective technique of obtaining its estimate. This helps in detecting the excessive tree felling than actual requirements and wildlife suitability.The main objective of this study was to develop and test crown diameter prediction models for silvicultural management of naturally grown Parkia biglobosa within the University of Agriculture, Makurdi. Nine 100 m x 100 m temporary sample plots were established using simple random sampling method. Crown diameter and stump diameter were measured in all living P. biglobosa trees with stump diameter &ge;10.0 cm. Least square method was used to convert the counted stumps into harvested crown dimension. Three linear and three non-linear models using stump diameter as the exploratory variable were developed and evaluated using the adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj.R2), standard error of estimate (SEE), prediction error sum of squares (PRESS) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). The crown-stump diameter relationship was best described by the double logarithmic function with \u00f0\u009d\u0090\u00b4\u00f0\u009d\u2018\u2018\u00f0\u009d\u2018\u2014.\u00f0\u009d\u2018\u20262=65.1%, \u00f0\u009d\u2018\u2020\u00f0\u009d\u0090\u00b8\u00f0\u009d\u0090\u00b8=0.1729, \u00f0\u009d\u2018\u0192\u00f0\u009d\u2018\u2026\u00f0\u009d\u0090\u00b8\u00f0\u009d\u2018\u2020\u00f0\u009d\u2018\u2020=262.9998 \u00f0\u009d\u2018\u017d\u00f0\u009d\u2018\u203a\u00f0\u009d\u2018\u2018 \u00f0\u009d\u0090\u00b4\u00f0\u009d\u0090\u00bc\u00f0\u009d\u0090\u00b6=717.56.The result showed that Crown diameter estimation was feasible even when the only information available is stump diameter.The resulting equation was tested for validation with independent data obtained from additional plots and was found to be desirable for estimating the crown diameter for Parkia biglobosa in Makurdi, Benue State, Nigeria</p>",

However, dearth of empirical means of expressing the dimensions, structure, quality and quantity of a removed tree has impede conviction of offenders. This study aimed at developing a model that can effectively estimate individual tree basal area (BA) from stump diameter (Ds) for Tectona grandis stands in Omo Forest Reserve, Nigeria, for timber valuation in case of illegal felling. Thirty-six 25 m\u00c3\u201425 m temporary sample plots (TSPs) were laid randomly in six age strata; 26, 23, 22, 16, 14, and 12 years specifically. BA, Ds and diameter at breast height were measured in all living T. grandis trees within the 36 TSPs. Least square method was used to convert the counted stumps into harvested stem cross-sectional areas.\r\nSix basal area models were fitted and evaluated. The BA-Ds relationship was best described by power model which gave least values of Root mean square error (0.0048), prediction error sum of squares (0.0325) and Akaike information criterion (-15391) with a high adjusted coefficient of determination (0.921). This study revealed that basal area estimation was realistic even when the only information available was stump diameter. The power model was validated using independent data obtained from additional plots and was found to be appropriate for estimating the basal area of Tectona grandis stands in Omo Forest Reserve, Nigeria.",

        "description": "Tree diameter is a very important variable in forestry; its accurate description is vital to planning if the forest is to be managed in a sustainable manner. Probability density functions are widely used for characterizing tree diameter. However, there is limited information on the diameter distribution for most of plantation in the country especially in the study area. Therefore, this research assesses the performance and suitability of beta, 3-parameter gamma, 3-parameter lognormal and 3-parameter Weibull distribution functions for fitting diameter at breast height (Dbh) of the second rotation of Tectona grandis Linn.f plantation in Eda Forest Reserve, Nigeria. Sixteen (16) temporary sample plots, (each 20 m x 20 m) were randomly selected across four second rotation age series (7, 8, 10 and 11 years), whose original ages were 24, 31, 32 and 37 respectively. The distribution functions were fitted using maximum likelihood estimators. The performance of each function was tested using the\r\nKolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic, Anderson Darling test, Chi-square, mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE). The test results revealed that 3-Parameter Weibull distribution was the most suitable for characterising Dbh. Weibull distribution had the least Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (0.0453), Anderson Darling test (1.231), Chi-square (24.9700), mean absolute error (0.0964) and mean square error (2.1688). Therefore, 3-parameter Weibull distribution is the best and recommended for fitting Dbh of second rotation T. grandis species in the study area for sustainable teak timber management.",

Despite global recognition of the role of forests in mitigation of climate change, deforestation and forest degradation continues to increase. However, there is dearth of information on the impact of situating University of Ibadan International Conference Centre (UIICC) on the University&rsquo;s Tectona grandis plantation. Hence, provision of baseline information on the impact of the Conference Centre on the environment will help management decisions on mitigation of its negative effects. Environmental impact assessment of UIICC on the adjoining forest was conducted. The data used for this study was obtained from all living T. grandis (332 trees) found within seven randomly laid sample plots of 25 m &times; 25 m. Diameters at several points of tree stems and height (total and merchantable) were measured. Hence, biomass of each sampled tree was estimated. Point coordinates were also obtained to map out the boundaries of the various land cover within the study area. The impact assessment results revealed that about 7066 trees with merchantable volume of 601.55 m3 and total volume of 1266.58 m3 were removed for building of UIICC covering about 9.309 ha. About 274.99 t C and 1009.28 t CO2 e carbon and carbon dioxide, respectively were loss. Furthermore, loss of biodiversity and habitat for animals (birds, reptiles and rodents) and disruptions of biogeochemical cycles were among the identified negative impacts. Planting of avenue trees within the conference centre, proper waste disposal and use of renewable energy were recommended as mitigation measures.</p>",

        "description": "Crown area which is crown size, is closely related to the photosynthetic capacity of tree and it is an important parameter to characterize biomass, leaf area and wildlife habitats. Conversely, assessment of crown dimensions still remain one of the most difficult and tedious task in forestry. The difficult measurements and the sensitivity of crown dimension on management makes it desirable to develop estimation procedures based on variables that are easier to measure than crown extension itself. The main objective of this study was to develop and observe the effects of tree slenderness coefficient in predicting crown area for Tectona grandis in Omo Forest Reserve. Twenty temporary sample plots of size 20 m x 20 m were randomly selected across the stand ages (9, 11, 12 and 18 years). Tree growth variables measured from each plot include diameter at breast height (Dbh) \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 5 cm, total height (THt) and crown diameter (CD). The data was analysed using descriptive, correlation and regression analyses. Amidst the models developed and verified, double logarithmic function with adj. R2 = 62.0%, RMSE = 0.265% and PRESS = 0.263 gave the best fit and predictive ability. This was also supported by the undeviating bands of the graphical analyses of the residual. Conversely, the inclusion of TSC had impact on the predictive abilities of the models which implies that slenderness coefficient typically indicates the size of crown dimension, centre of gravity and a better developed root system. Therefore, it is recommended that the model can be used by forest managers for the  development of stocking guideline.",

Crown ratio (CR) is an index of tree stability; it indicates tree vigour and is a useful parameter for assessing forest condition. This study aimed at assessing crown ratio for improved silvicultural management of naturally grown Prosopis africana species within the University of Agriculture Makurdi, Nigeria. Nine temporary sample plots (TSPs) of size 100 m x 100 m were established using simple random sampling method. Diameter at breast height (Dbh), total height (Ht) and crown diameter (Cd) and height to live crown base (HCB) were measured for all living P. africana trees with Dbh > 10 cm within the 9 TSPs. Data collected were subjected to descriptive and bivariate correlation analysis. The trees were further classified based on their Crown ratio as high vigour (CR>0.50), moderate vigour (CR= 0.30-0.50) and low vigour (CR<0.30). The result revealed that CR had strong negative correlation with Ht and HCB. Tree diameter attributes showed low positive correlation with CR. However, about 69% of the trees are within moderate CR class and only 3% are of the low CR class. This implies that majority of the P. africana species in the study area are of moderate and high vigour. Hence, appropriate silvicultural Treatment such as thinning is recommended for trees with CR <0.3 to ensure moderate, better stand stability and sustainability of the species benefits.",

Point coordinates (2,272) with their respective\r\nelevations were randomly obtained covering the entire study area. Interpolated natural neighbour algorithm of the Quantum Geographic Information System was used to generate Digital Elevation Model for the National Park from the elevation data. Topographic map was extracted from the DEM at an interval of 10 m from one another. It was observed that the elevation in the study area ranged from 19 m to 105 m with an average of 56.32 m above sea\r\nlevel. Hence, the parkland is regarded as a gentle slope. This study revealed that the study area is not prone to flood or runoff due to its gentle slope nature.

The best substrate for propagation was assessed: (0) wetland; (1) sand/wetland; (2) sawdust/wetland; (3) sand/sawdust/wetland. Young shoots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 growth was observed in situ for 8 weeks. A significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed in the appearance of young shoots and leaves in nursery. The highest average number of young shoots and leaves (0.62 \u00c2\u00b1 0.09) was found in substrates 0 and 1, the lowest (0.31 \u00c2\u00b1 0.08) in substrate 3. Substrate 3 showed the lowest number of young leaves (0.41 \u00c2\u00b1 0.16) and substrate 2 the highest (0.97 \u00c2\u00b1 0.24). A significant difference in the mortality rate of cuttings (P < 0.05) was observed: 68.75% and 53.12% in substrates 2 and 3, respectively. On farm, new leaves and young shoots\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 appearance showed a highly significant difference. Plants growing in substrates 2 and 3 showed the highest number of leaves. New shoots developed only in plants growing in substrates 0 and 1.

Ethnobotanical surveys were conducted to investigate the relationships between the local population and the gallery forest; the spatio-temporal dynamics of the landscapes around the gallery forest were studied from the diachronic analysis of three Landsat TM satellite images of 1984, Landsat ETM + 1999 and \r\nLandsat OLI_TIRS of 2016, supplemented by verification missions on field. The satellite images were processed using ArcGIS and Erdas Imagine software. According to surveys, it should be noted that agriculture and livestock are the main economic activities of the population of Koupa Matapit, agriculture and fuel wood collection for energy were the main anthropogenic activities responsible for deforestation and degradation of the forest gallery. \r\nThe collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) would have a significant implication in land use and cover changes. The results indicate that the extension of savannah/agricultural land (from 6989 ha in 1984 to 7604 ha in 2016) and bare soil/built up area (from 71 ha in 1984 to 342 ha in 2016) would have led to the disappearance of much of the forest area (1465 ha in 1984 to 580 ha in 2016). The rapid population growth of Koupa Matapit would be responsible for these pressures. There is an urgent need to implement appropriate land use policy in this area. ",

These savannahs  are  still  poorly  studied  and  their  sustainable  management  requires  precise  knowledge  in  terms  of  flora.  The present work is focused on the floristic diversity of the savannah in three different altitudes of the Bambouto Mountains, West Cameroon: the lower zone (1100-1600 m), the mid-zone (1600-2000 m) and the upper zone (above 2000 m). The data on the floristic composition were collected from the inventory of all the species present in the fifty-four quadrats of \r\n100 m\u00c2\u00b2 sampled in the studied area. The species richness and biological diversity index were used to express differences in diversity within the different altitude zones. A total of 209 species belonging to 139 genera and 63 families were recorded in the Bambouto Mountains. The lower zone was the richest (128 species) follow by the mid zone (107 species) \r\nand the upper zone (70 species). The species Imperata cylindrica and Aspilia africana were the most represented. The Poaceae and Asteraceae families  were the  most frequent,  the  most abundant and the richest in species in the altitude zones. Among the three altitudinal studied zones, the mid zone had the highest floristic diversity linked probably to the diversity of habitats. Diversity of plants was affected by parameters such as altitude, rainfall and soil types.",

        "title": "Phenological Behaviour of Tropical Tree Species in Three Altitudinal Zones of Bambouto Mountains, West Cameroon",
        "description": "Background and Objective: The great variety of phenological patterns in tropical mountain trees must not be explained only by climatic factors. Considering that soil water availability influences plant water status and total metabolism, soil conditions and altitude are also expected to be important for the regulation of plant reproductive and vegetative activities over time. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of climatic factors and altitude on the phenology of Entada africana and Tephrosia vogelii in three altitudinal zones of the Bambouto Mountains, West Cameroon. Materials and Methods: Phenological (flushing, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting) data were monitored monthly in the dry season and every 2 weeks in the rainy season from October, 2012 to September, 2013 for 120 trees of two tree species (60 trees for each species and 20 in each zone) in three altitudinal zones: The lower zone (1100-1600 m), the mid-zone (1600-2000 m) and the upper zone (above 2000 m). Results: Each species phenological patterns were alike and marked by seasonality on the phenophases in the same zone. However, the frequency, peak and intensity of the phenophases in the three altitudinal zones were distinct. Leaf initiation activity in E. africana and T. vogelii were associated with maximum temperature in dry season. Flowering activity started in the rainy season. Fruit initiation were associated with rainfall in rainy season, the dehiscence of fruits was completed in dry season. Precocity of leaf-initiation in the dry season and delayed of flowering, fruiting in the rainy season in response to the effect of climatic conditions and altitude was observed in the upper zone. Conclusion: Climate and altitude were the important factors affecting phenological patterns in tropical mountain tree species.",

        "description": "Many rural areas are experiencing rapid social-ecological changes, impacting livelihoods and creating less certain futures. Despite several decades of research on the use of locally collected environmental resources, there have been few repeat studies, especially in South and Southern Africa, to consider how households may be altering such use alongside other changes. This paper explores changes in the use of environmental resources by communities in the Kat River Valley, South Africa over a fifteen-year period, between 2000 and 2015, using a repeat survey, key informant interviews and other data from a larger study relating to social-ecological change. The proportion of households collecting differ-ent environmental resources was similar between the two periods. However, the mean quantities used per household had declined for several resources. Consequently, the monetary contribution or worth of these to livelihoods also declined, except for fuelwood and river sand. These changes can be related to, amongst others, transformations in both the local landscape and socio-economic environments, such as increases in state social welfare, a decline in agricultural production, woody plant encroachment, generational preferences,  and  the expansion of supermarket retailers. Understanding such trends is important for considering the sustainable management of landscapes and livelihoods into the future.",

        "description": "<p>After the 1992 Rio Conference, the adoption of Agenda 21, the launching of the MDGs and, more recently, the SDGs, the technical and financial partners of developing countries such as Cameroon, make environmental assessments a prerequisite for the financing of the plans. , programs and development policies. To this end, Cameroon has adopted legislative, regulatory and institutional mechanisms for the management of forests, wildlife and fisheries, as well as for environmental management. These provisions, among other things, provide for the prior completion of the environmental assessment for plans, programs and projects. Thus, the purpose of this final thesis, which is part of an environmental assessment, is to &quot; perform an environmental assessment of a Support Program to the Ecosystem Conservation and Climate Change Resilience in the Lobek&eacute; National Park (LNP) and its Peripheral Zone &quot;, to improve the effectiveness of its management, as well as that of future initiatives or programs. In order to achieve this objective, assumptions have been made in the light of: The management of the Lobek&eacute; National Park (LNP) and its Peripheral Zone is not effective because it does not sufficiently take into account the local development and the resilience of the neighboring populations in the context of Climate Change. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the currently applied model of the conservation-development dynamics and identified the weaknesses of this model by applying a methodology adapted to environmental and social assessment. These include (i) conducting surveys, free and guided interviews, focus groups and the the accelerated method of participatory research (MARP). The literature search gathered all the necessary secondary data. On the basis of the analyzes carried out and the gap identified, we have proposed, an optimal strategic support for response, in terms of programmatic articulation of intervention, focused on the human being at the heart of conservation &quot;Anthropic approach in contra of Biocentrism&quot; and consisting of four components that are : (i) Local development and resilience to climate change, (ii) Capacity building and good governance, (iii) Sustainable management of biodiversity and, (iv) Coordination and results-based management of the Program . The study therefore demonstrates that the current model of the conservation and development dynamics is not effective and that the proposed Program, which places the well-being of the local population at the center of action, has potential positive impacts of major importance for improving livelihoods communities, their local development and ecosystem conservation concomitantly. Recommendations were also made to help improve the effectiveness of protected area management. KEY WORDS:</p>",

        "description": "In Thailand, Eucalyptus urophylla was introduced with the main purpose of supplying raw material for\r\npulp and chip wood production. The demand for genetically improved seed is increasing to support high\r\nproductivity plantation establishment. One of the tree improvement activities established to meet the\r\nhigh demand for improved seed was a second generation progeny test at Lad Krating Plantation, Thailand\r\nto provide the best material for the successful plantation program. The aim of the current study was to\r\ncompare growth variation of the first and second generation of Eucalyptus urophylla progeny that could\r\nprovide information on suitable families for improved quality seed. The progeny test comprised the best\r\n45 half-sib families selected from 80 half-sib families of the first-generation progeny test. The design of\r\nthe progeny test was a randomized and complete block design (16 trees/plot \u0001 45 plots/block \u0001 9\r\nblocks), with 4 rows of 4 trees at a spacing of 2 m \u0001 1 m. Growth was assessed at age 3 yr. The average\r\nheight and diameter at breast height over bark (DBH), was 13.72 m, and 8.75 cm, respectively. There were\r\nhighly significant (p < 0.01) differences among provenances and families in both height and DBH. The\r\nindividual heritability values for height and DBH were 0.48 and 0.60, respectively. The family heritability\r\nvalues for height and DBH were 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. These 45 half-sib families proved to be\r\ngenetically superior ensuring higher productivity and contributing to the success of the Forest Industry\r\nOrganization plantation at Lad Krating.",

        "title": "Monitoring the harvesting of the barks of Prunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkman (Rosaceae) in the agroforest systems of North West region of Cameroon. ",
        "description": "Prunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkman is a specie of the Rosaceae family, known under its trade name as pygeum or African cherry. The bark is the major source of an extract used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. From 2008-2011, Cameroon government with the assistance of the ITTOCITES Program has managed to regulate the harvesting of Prunus africana in natural forest. The reality is quite different  in the field since harvesters have focused on the Prunus found in agroforest systems to satify the demand of the international market. This paper therefore aims to monitor the harvesting of barks of P. africana  in agroforest systems found in the North west region of Cameroon. Inventories were conducted in August, 2016, in 17 P. africana plantations located in the following three subdivisions: Fundong in the Boyo division, Kumbo in the Bui division, and Tubah in the Mezam division. The density of P. africana recorded is 5.15 trees/ha. The exploitable stems represent only 7.5%, illustrating that these plantations are still very young. This feature is confirmed by the low value of the average diameter of trees 10.79\u00c2\u00b15.67 cm and the average thickness of the bark 5.01\u00c2\u00b11.71 mm. The average diameter annual increment is 0.91\u00c2\u00b10.46 cm/year, while the average regeneration rate of the bark is 1.91\u00c2\u00b11.03 mm/year.  The diameter annual increment increases, while the regeneration rate of the bark decreases with diameter at least till 40 cm diameter. The harvesting of Prunus bark done in those plantations till now is non-sustainable, since harvesters do not respect advised norms which are the minimum exploitable diameter (MED) of 30 cm and the use of 2/4 and 4/8 techniques of debarking. The combination of the two elements related to the respect of norms (MED and the harvesting technique), reveals that 91% of trees are harvested unsustainably. The analysis done on the regeneration rate tends to show that, the more the young Prunus trees are traumatized, the more  they develop capacity of regenerating their bark, at least till ages of 10-12 years and at diameters 30-40 cm. Harvesting activity does not induce the death of trees, but it causes the wilting of some trees. The use of nonsustainable harvesting techniques including the \u00c2\u00bd side and the total debarking is the main cause of the wilting of trees. ",

        "title": "Quantitative Ethobotany of Gnetum africanum Welw. (Gnetaceae) in Massoumboum, Littoral Region of Cameroon.",
        "description": "Gnetum africanum Welw. is a plant specie of Central and West Africa, a Non Timber Forest Product (NTFP) with high nutritional, medicinal and economic value. In Cameroon, its leaves are recognized by the forestry administration as a special product. Strong demand combined with destructive harvesting techniques has resulted in its rarity in its distribution area. The objective of this work is to characterize the harvesting and trade of G. africanaum, and to assess its abundance (density and structure) in order to appreciate the economic value of the Lehman agroforest system (ALM) based in Massoumboum, a village located at 30 Km of Douala town, the economical capital of Cameroon. An ethnobotanical survey was conducted among harvesters and sellers of G. africanum in the ALM and in adjacent markets. An inventory of G. africanum stems and leaves was carried out at an overall sampling rate of 9.52%. The study revealed that, harvesting of G. africanum is freely done by women, youngers and elders. They start their activity early in the morning and convey their products to markets located in the periphery and inside the city of Douala. The price of the gramme is too high in the periphery than in the city, averaging 0.58 CFA franc. This price is high in the dry season due to the scarcity of other agricultural vegetables. The inventories conducted revealed densities of 6 191 stems/ha and 119 548 leaves/ha, with the high density of leaves obtained in less perturbed plots. The combination of field data (forest inventories) with those obtained in the markets (trade data), what we call \u00c2\u00ab quantitative ethnobotany \u00c2\u00bb, allowed us to appreciate the temporal economic value (EV) of the ALM. This EV ranges from 500 000 - 700 000 CFA franc, for an average value of 37 059.9 CFA franc /ha. If well managed, G. africanum can contribute not only to the economy of the women-harvesters, but also to the economy of the ALM. The glaring development challenge of the background of what precedes is the development of non-detriment findings (NDF) for G. africanum in Cameroon. These consist of setting tools which aims to sustain the resource and trade such as the delimitation of Gnetum Allocation Units (GAU), as well as the development and implementation of simple management plans (SMPs).

Floristic inventory and diversity assessments were necessary to understand the species composition and diversity status of forests, trees biomass and investigate the potential impact of the project. Floristic analysis shows a high Shannon diversity index (5.3), indicating a rich and diverse flora composed of 83 species, 73 genera and 29 families among which one endanger species (Diospyros crassiflora), two lower risk/near threatened species (Dialium bipendense, Irvingia gabonensis) and vulnerable species mostly wood with high marketing value (Afzelia bipindensis, Entandrophragma angolensis, Entandrophragma utile, Khaya ivorensis, Lovoa trichilio&iuml;des, Pterygota macrocarpa). The mean basal area (28 to 50 m&sup2;/ha) reflects the presence of patches of disturbed and non disturbed forest with high frequency of small size trees and few canopy trees with large buttresses. Tree biomass is estimated at 2840 Mg (379 Mg/ha) and carbon stock 189.31 MgC/ha. Ecological impact can be mitigating by a management plan which includes a sustainable choice of urbanization and an emphasis on the protection of biodiversity in the remaining forest especially Campo Ma&rsquo;an national park known as hot spot of biodiversity and where all the censored species can be found.</p>",

        "description": "This study characterizes the floristic and structural traits of trees in three sites of rainforest of Cameroon. The sites were exposed to di\u00ef\u00ac\u20acerent intensities of disturbances: Mangombe, highly and frequently disturbed; Bidou, moderately disturbed and Campo, undisturbed. Data collection were carried in a disposive comprising 65 plots of 20 m \u00c3\u2014 20 m randomly installed in each site for inventory, identification and measurement of diameter of trees greather than 10 cm at 1.30 m height. In total, 4717 plants belonging to 130 species and 43 families were recorded in all the sites. Basal area showed a declining trend with the increase in disturbance intensity while tree density, species richness and families increase with disturbances: Campo (87 m\u00c2\u00b2/ha, 569 trees/ha, 75 species and 29 families); Bidou (54, 538, 88 and 32); Mangombe (49, 708, 91 and 38). The vegetation indices showed a high diversity in all the sites. The Shannon index (5.40 to 5.52) and generic diversity (1.10 to 1.16) had greater value. According to the sample, the floristic composition of Mangombe considerably differs from those of Bidou and Campo. The undisturbed site (Campo) contained young tree population showing a vigorous regeneration while in the highly disturbed site (Mangombe), tree density was scarce, with few big size trees having high cultural importance and low economic value. Low shrub density was recorded in Mangombe and Bidou due to frequent human disturbances. Canopy gaps favor direct sunlight which enhanced the abundance of Shrub in all the sites. More protection is needed for the restoration in the long term of forest cover in Mangombe, which can be done naturally due to high density of small trees composed of species generally found in the upper strata.

The demand for genetically improved seed is increasing to support high\r\nproductivity plantation establishment. One of the tree improvement activities established to meet the\r\nhigh demand for improved seed was a second generation progeny test at Lad Krating Plantation, Thailand\r\nto provide the best material for the successful plantation program. The aim of the current study was to\r\ncompare growth variation of the first and second generation of Eucalyptus urophylla progeny that could\r\nprovide information on suitable families for improved quality seed. The progeny test comprised the best\r\n45 half-sib families selected from 80 half-sib families of the first-generation progeny test. The design of\r\nthe progeny test was a randomized and complete block design (16 trees/plot \u0001 45 plots/block \u0001 9\r\nblocks), with 4 rows of 4 trees at a spacing of 2 m \u0001 1 m. Growth was assessed at age 3 yr. The average\r\nheight and diameter at breast height over bark (DBH), was 13.72 m, and 8.75 cm, respectively. There were\r\nhighly significant (p < 0.01) differences among provenances and families in both height and DBH.

        "description": "Climate change literature is rife with the assertion that women are more vulnerable to climate change, which state is expected to reflect on female-headed households. However, this assertion has however not been empirically proven aside from the general poverty-gender linkages. This study used primary data collected in 2016 from 735 randomly selected households from four districts in Eastern Uganda to construct a gender vulnerability index to compare and explain the drivers of vulnerability between male and female-headed households. The results show that female-headed households were more vulnerable (GVI-IPCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.134) than male-headed households (GVI-IPCC\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00e2\u02c6\u20190.176). The results further show that disparity in adaptive capacity mediates vulnerability between male and female-headed households. This underscores the importance of proactive interventions rather than protectionist approaches to reducing vulnerability. The study has extended the analytical utility of the livelihood vulnerability index to create a gender vulnerability index for comparing contextual groups of households in Eastern Uganda.",

        "title": "Expansion of Commercial Sugarcane Cultivation among Smallholder Farmers in Uganda: Implications for Household Food Security ",
        "description": "<p>Understanding the impact of commercial agriculture in the face of global change is critical to support strategies that ensure food security and alleviate poverty among households. We assessed the contribution of commercial sugarcane cultivation to household-level food security among smallholder farmers in Busoga sub-region, eastern Uganda. Land use changes are motivated by quick commercial gains rather than sustained food production; a situation that influences food security. The majority of households cultivate few crop varieties, lack adequate and nutritious foods, and have inadequate income to purchase food to meet their needs. Inadequacy of food within some commercial sugarcane-cultivating households suggests that generating income does not necessarily increase food security. To cope with food insecurity, households offer labour in exchange for food, borrow food, ration food, and at times steal. This is exacerbated by increasing food crop failures, large family sizes, trade in food items, and declining availability of food and land for food production. Commercial sugarcane cultivation is the main driver of food insecurity but given its perceived economic benefits, future sugarcane plantations expansion in the region is probably inevitable. Therefore, future policy should be designed to provide triple-win strategies (i.e., food security, poverty alleviation, and climate change adaptation) that provide sustainable livelihoods</p>",

The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of FFS in facilitating smallholder farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adaptation to drought in Kiboga District inclusive of gender and communication perspectives. A total of 120 FFS-members and 60 non-members were randomly selected and administered with questionnaires in Kapeka, Dwaniro and Bukomero sub-counties. Using descriptive statistics, the results revealed that in crop production, the FFS members largely responded to drought by early/delayed planting, carrying out micro-irrigation, growing of vegetables, rainwater harvesting and application of organic manure; while in livestock production, they fetched water, sold livestock, grew hay, hired shelter for livestock protection and collected feeds. These divergent options were incomparable to those applied by the non-FFS members. Irrespective of memberships, the women were more directly involved in crop and livestock adaptation-related activities compared to their counterparts. In addition, both FFS members and non-members revealed to have implemented adaptation responses learned from fellow farmers, friends, community announcers, extension officers, and local council leaders. As a result, the application of adaptation responses increased the smallholder farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social relations, income levels, and food security status.",

        "title": "Analysis of Future Climate Scenarios over Central Uganda Cattle Corridor ",
        "description": "<p>The study employed a Regional Climate Model (RCM), Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies (PRECIS), to examine the future climate scenarios over the central Uganda cattle corridor districts of Nakaseke and Nakasongola in the near future (2021-2050) and mid-century (2051-2080). The study was guided by two questions: what are the projected temperature and rainfall values for the central Uganda cattle corridor in relation to IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and A1B Scenarios for the same periods; how do they compare with the new set of scenarios known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) in the same area for the same period? The scenarios were obtained using PRECIS software and delta methods using R software according to the AGMIP protocols for SRES and RCP; respectively. Results show both SRES A2 and A1B projecting temperature increases in average monthly, seasonal as well as annual for both near future and mid centuryperiods with A2 showing a mean annual temperature increase of 2.5 to 4.4&deg;C in the near future and 4.5 to 6.0&deg;C in the mid century relative to the 1981-2010 average compared to A1B which shows annual temperature increase of 0.7 -1.7&deg;C in the near future and 1.7-3.5&deg;C in the far future. The same trend is observed for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 but the increments are lower for the RCPs compared to the SRES. Projections for rainfall show a slight increase in annual rainfall in both SRES and RCPs. However more rainfall is projected for the second rainfall season of September to November compared to the usual known season of March to May (MAM). The projections also show a shift in rainfall with the usual dry season of December to February (DJF) now becoming wetter than the 1980-2010 average. This shift is consistent in all the scenarios and has also been observed in other studies done in the region. From the results farmers should be advised to take advantage of the projected increases in rainfall especially.</p>",

        "description": "Human-aided movement of species populations in large scale reforestation programs could be a potent and cost effective climate change adaptation strategy. Such large-scale management interventions, however, tend to entail the risks of unintended consequences, and we propose that three conditions should be met before implementing assisted migration in reforestation programs: (1) evidence of a climate-related adaptational lag, (2) observed biological impacts, and (3) robust model projections to target assisted migration efforts. In a case study of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux.) we use reciprocal transplant experiments to study adaptation of tree populations to local environments. Secondly, we monitor natural aspen populations using the MODIS enhanced vegetation index as a proxy for forest health and productivity. Lastly, we report results from bioclimate envelope models that predict suitable habitat for locally adapted genotypes under observed and predicted climate change. The combined results support assisted migration prescriptions and indicate that the risk of inaction likely exceeds the risk associated with changing established management practices. However, uncertainty in model projections\r\nalso implies that we are restricted to a relatively short 20-year planning horizon for prescribing seed movement in reforestation programs. We believe that this study exemplifies a safe and realistic climate change adaptation strategy based on multiple sources of information and some understanding of the uncertainty associated with recommendations for assisted migration. Ad hoc migration prescriptions without a similar level of supporting information should be avoided in reforestation programs.",

        "title": "Bioclimate envelope model predictions for natural resource management: Dealing with uncertainty",
        "description": "Summary\r\n1.\u00e2\u20ac\u201aBioclimate envelope models are widely used to predict the potential distribution of species under climate change, but they are conceptually also suitable to match policies and practices to anticipated or observed climate change, for example through species choice in reforestation. Projections of bioclimate envelope models, however, come with large uncertainties due to different climate change scenarios, modelling methods and other factors.\r\n\r\n2\u00e2\u20ac\u201a In this paper we present a novel approach to evaluate uncertainty in model-based recommendations for natural resource management. Rather than evaluating variability in modelling results as a whole, we extract a particular statistic of interest from multiple model runs, e.g. species suitability for a particular reforestation site. Then, this statistic is subjected to analysis of variance, aiming to narrow the range of projections that practitioners need to consider.\r\n\r\n3.\u00e2\u20ac\u201aIn four case studies for western Canada we evaluate five sources of uncertainty with two to five treatment levels, including modelling methods, interpolation type for climate data, inclusion of topo-edaphic variables, choice of general circulation models, and choice of emission scenarios. As dependent variables, we evaluate changes to tree species habitat and ecosystem distributions under 144 treatment combinations.\r\n\r\n4.\u00e2\u20ac\u201aFor these case studies, we find that the inclusion of topo-edaphic variables as predictors reduces projected habitat shifts by a quarter, and general circulation models had major main effects. Our contrasting modelling approaches primarily contributed to uncertainty through interaction terms with climate change predictions, i.e. the methods behaved differently for particular climate change scenarios (e.g. warm & moist scenarios) but similar for others.\r\n\r\n5.\u00e2\u20ac\u201aSynthesis and applications. Partitioning of variance components helps with the interpretation of modelling results and reveals how models can most efficiently be improved. Quantifying variance components for main effects and interactions among sources of uncertainty also offers researchers the opportunity to filter out biologically and statistically unreasonable modelling results, providing practitioners with an improved range of predictions for climate-informed natural resource management.",

For each of these time periods, we provide a large set of basic and derived biologically relevant climate variables, such as growing and chilling degree days, growing season length descriptors, frost free days, extreme minimum temperatures, etc. To balance file size versus accuracy for these approximately 15,000 climate surfaces, we provide a stand-alone software solution that adds or subtracts historical data and future projections as medium resolution anomalies (deviations) from the high resolution 1961&ndash;1990 baseline normal dataset. For a relative quality comparison between the original normal data generated with the Parameter Regression of Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and derived historical data, we calculated the amount of variance explained (R2) in original weather station data for each year and month from 1901 to 2006. R2 values remained very high for most of the time period covered for most variables. Reduction in data quality was found for individual months (as opposed to annual, decadal or 30-year climate averages) and for the early decades of the last century. We discuss the limitations of the database and provide an overview of recent climate trends for western Canada.</p>",

Locally it is used for cash income, local beverage preparation and medicinal values. The contribution of the crop has grown steadfastly due to the demand in local markets and the promotion of the plant as one of the biophysical methods to maintain soil and water conservation structures. Besides, its economic value, the production and constraints of Rhamnus prinoides is not documented formally and scientifically in Ethiopia at all. This study was therefore conducted to assess the production and constraints of Rhamnus prinoides in one of the major production areas of the country. Data was collected from formal household survey and field observation and analyzed by descriptive statistics and linear regression model. The result revealed that the households of the region have on average 145seedlings/plants of Rhamnus prinoides mainly around the homestead. Cutting the stem from the bottom of the tree, cutting the new branch by sickle, rolling the shoots and leaves by hand and picking only the leaf by hand are the harvesting techniques practiced by the households. The farmers harvest on a rate of 2.48 per annum with average marketable leaf yield of 13.8kg per tree per harvest. The presence of provenance was reported based on the morphology of leaf, stem and fruits.

        "title": "Using terrestrial laser scanning data to estimate large tropical trees biomass and calibrate allometric models: A comparison with traditional destructive approach",
        "description": "Calibration of local, regional or global allometric equations to estimate biomass at the tree level constitutes a significant burden on projects aiming at reducing Carbon emissions from forest degradation and deforestation. The objective of this contribution is to assess the precision and accuracy of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) for estimating volumes and above-ground biomass (AGB) of the woody parts of tropical trees, and for the calibration of allometric models. We used a destructive dataset of 61 trees, with diameters and AGB of up to 186.6 cm and 60 Mg respectively, which were scanned, felled and weighed in the semi-deciduous forests of eastern Cameroon. We present an operational approach based on available software allowing the retrieving of TLS volume with low bias and high accuracy for large tropical trees. Edition of the obtained models proved necessary, mainly to account for the complexity of buttressed parts of tree trunks, which were separately modelled through a meshing approach, and to bring a few corrections in the topology and geometry of branches, thanks to the amapstudio-scan software. Over the entire dataset, TLS-derived volumes proved highly reliable for branches larger than 5 cm in diameter. The volumes of the remaining woody parts estimated for stumps, stems and crowns as well as for the whole tree proved very accurate (RMSE below 2.81% and R2 above of .98) and unbiased. Once converted into AGB using mean local-specific wood density values, TLS estimates allowed calibrating a biomass allometric model with coefficients statistically undistinguishable from those of a model based on destructive data. The Unedited Quantitative Structure Model (QSM) however leads to systematic overestimations of woody volumes and subsequently to significantly different allometric parameters. We can therefore conclude that a non-destructive TLS approach can now be used as an operational alternative to traditional destructive sampling to build the allometric equations, although attention must be paid to the quality of QSM model adjustments to avoid systematic bias.",

        "title": "Using volume-weighted average wood specific gravity of trees reduces bias in aboveground biomass predictions from forest volume data",
        "description": "With the improvement of remote sensing techniques for forest inventory application such as terrestrial LiDAR, tree volume can now be measured directly, without resorting to allometric equations. However, wood specific gravity (WSG) remains a crucial factor for converting these precise volume measurements into unbiased biomass estimates. In addition to this WSG values obtained from samples collected at the base of the tree (WSGBase) or from global repositories such as Dryad (WSGDryad) can be substantially biased relative to the overall tree value. Our aim was to assess and mitigate error propagation at tree and stand level using a pragmatic approach that could be generalized to National Forest Inventories or other carbon assessment efforts based on measured volumetric data. In the semi-deciduous forests of Eastern Cameroon, we destructively sampled 130 trees belonging to 15 species mostly represented by large trees (up to 45 Mg). We also used stand-level dendrometric parameters from 21 1-ha plots inventoried in the same area to propagate the tree-level bias at the plot level. A new descriptor, volume average-weighted WSG (WWSG) of the tree was computed by weighting the WSG of tree compartments by their relative volume prior to summing at tree level. As WWSG cannot be assessed non-destructively, linear models were adjusted to predict field WWSG and revealed that a combination of WSGDryad, diameter at breast height (DBH) and species stem morphology (Sm) were significant predictors explaining together 72% of WWSG variation. At tree level, estimating tree aboveground biomass using WSGBaseand WSGDryadyielded overestimations of 10% and 7% respectively whereas predicted WWSG only produced an underestimation of less than 1%. At stand-level, WSGBaseand WSGDryadgave an average simulated bias of 9% (S.D. = \u00c2\u00b17) and 3% (S.D. = \u00c2\u00b17) respectively whereas predicted WWSG reduced the bias by up to 0.1% (S.D. = \u00c2\u00b18). We also observed that the stand-level bias obtained with WSGBaseand WSGDryaddecreased with total plot size and plot area. The systematic bias induced by WSGBaseand WSGDryadfor biomass estimations using measured volumes are clearly not negligible but yet generally overlooked. A simple corrective approach such as the one proposed with our predictive WWSG model is liable to improve the precision of remote sensing-based approaches for broader scale biomass estimations.",

        "title": "Upscaling forest biomass from field to satellite measurements: sources of errors and ways to reduce them ",
        "description": "<p>Forest biomass monitoring is at the core of the research agenda due to the critical impor -tance of forest dynamics in the carbon cycle. However, forest biomass is never directly measured; thus, upscaling it from trees to stand or larger scales (e.g., countries, regions) relies on a series of statistical models that may propagate large errors. Here, we review the main steps usually adopted in forest aboveground biomass mapping, highlighting the major challenges and perspectives. We show that there is room for improvement along the scaling-up chain from field data collection to satellite-based large-scale mapping, which should lead to the adoption of effective practices to better control the propagation of errors. We specifically illustrate how the increasing use of emerging technologies to collect mas -sive amounts of high-quality data may significantly improve the accuracy of forest car -bon maps. Furthermore, we discuss how sources of spatially structured biases that directly propagate into remote sensing models need to be better identified and accounted for when extrapolating forest carbon estimates, e.g., through a stratification design. We finally discuss the increasing realism of 3D simulated stands, which, through radiative transfer modelling, may contribute to a better understanding of remote sensing signals and open avenues for the direct calibration of large-scale products, thereby circumventing several current difficulties.</p>",

        "description": "Direct and semidirect estimations of leaf area (LA) and leaf area index (LAI) are scarce in dense tropical forests despite their importance in calibrating remote sensing products, forest dynamics, and biogeochemical models. We destructively sampled 61 trees belonging to 13 most abundant species in a semideciduous forest in southeastern Cameroon. For each tree, all leaves were weighed, and for a subsample of branches, leaves were counted and the LA measured. Allometric models were calibrated to allow semidirect estimation of LAI at tree and stand levels based on forest inventory data (R2 = 0.7, bias = 21.2%, error = 39.5%) and on predictors that could be extracted from very high resolution remote sensing data (R2 = 0.63, bias = 35.1%, error = 58.73). Using twenty\u00e2\u20ac\u0090one 1\u00e2\u20ac\u0090ha forest plots, stand level estimations of LAI ranged from 4.42\u00e2\u20ac\u201c13.99. These values are higher than previous estimates generally obtained using indirect methods. These results may have important consequences on ecosystem exchanges and the role of tropical forest in global cycles.",

        "title": "Closing a gap in tropical forest biomass estimation: Taking crown mass variation into account in pantropical allometries",
        "description": "Accurately monitoring tropical forest carbon stocks is a challenge that remains outstanding. Allometric models that consider tree diameter, height and wood density as predictors are currently used in most tropical forest carbon studies. In particular, a pantropical biomass model has been widely used for approximately a decade, and its most recent version will certainly constitute a reference model in the coming years. However, this reference model shows a systematic bias towards the largest trees. Because large trees are key drivers of forest carbon stocks and dynamics, understanding the origin and the consequences of this bias is of utmost concern. In this study, we compiled a unique tree mass data set of 673 trees destructively sampled in five tropical countries (101 trees > 100 cm in diameter) and an original data set of 130 forest plots (1 ha) from central Africa to quantify the prediction error of biomass allometric models at the individual and plot levels when explicitly taking crown mass variations into account or not doing so. We first showed that the proportion of crown to total tree aboveground biomass is highly variable among trees, ranging from 3 to 88 %. This proportion was constant on average for trees < 10Mg (mean of 34 %) but, above this threshold, increased sharply with tree mass and exceeded 50% on average for trees \u00e2\u2030\u00a5 45 Mg. This increase coincided with a progressive deviation between the pantropical biomass model estimations and actual tree mass. Taking a crown mass proxy into account in a newly developed model consistently removed the bias observed for large trees (> 1 Mg) and reduced the range of plot-level error (in %) from [-23; 16] to [0; 10]. The disproportionally higher allocation of large trees to crown mass may thus explain the bias observed recently in the reference pantropical model. This bias leads to far-from-negligible, but often overlooked, systematic errors at the plot level and may be easily corrected by taking a crown mass proxy for the largest trees in a stand into account, thus suggesting that the accuracy of forest carbon estimates can be significantly improved at a minimal cost. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Author(s).",

        "description": "Assessment of plant species composition and diversity of International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Forest Reserve, Ibadan, Nigeria was carried out to facilitate forest conservation and restoration. Two transects, each measuring 500m long were laid systematically for the study. Next, ten 25m x 25m sampling plots were demarcated on each transect for enumeration and identification of trees, shrubs and climbers. Further, 1m x1m subplots were demarcated for enumeration and identification of herbs and lianas. Shannon-Wiener diversity and Simpson indexes were used to assess species diversity, evenness indices and richness. Species richness in the Reserve was: trees (58), shrubs (26), climbers (15), herbs (6) and lianas (4). Species diversity (H\u00c2\u00b4) and species evenness (E) were: trees (3.18, 0.41), shrubs (2.97, 0.72), climbers (2.31, 0.67), herbs (1.36, 0.78), and lianas (0.73, 0.69), respectively. Stand density was 1255 trees/ha while basal area was 23.10m2ha-1. There was a decrease in the number of individual trees in various diameter classes as size increased. The Forest Reserve was dominated by Malvaceae, Leguminosae, Apocynaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Moraceae families. Newbouldia laevis, Sphenocentrum jollyanum, Acacia ataxacantha, Chromolaena odorata, and Cnestis ferruginea were the most abundant trees, shrubs, climbers, herb and lianas, respectively. Species population structure indicated high species diversity; therefore, management plan should be put in place for species conservation.\r\nKey words: Species diversity, species dominance, IITA Forest Reserve, Shannon Weiner index, Simpson index\r\n",

The objective was to compare poultry manure as an organic fertilizer\r\nto the commonly used commercial mineral fertilizer, and establish the rate and frequency of manure application.\r\nSix fertilization treatments were applied in a randomized block design monitored during five years: one control (0 g N),\r\none mineral fertilizer treatment (20 g N tree-1 year-1 as 20-10-10 (NPK)) and four poultry manure applications ((4-1-2\r\nNPK) 20 g N tree-1 year-1, 40 g N tree-1 year-1, 40 g N tree-1 every two years and 80 g N tree-1/2 yrs). Photosynthesis, soil\r\nrespiration and specific leaf area were slightly increased by the manure treatments. Height and diameter relative growth\r\nrates were similar among fertilization treatments. Manure treated trees had nutritional status similar or better than mineral\r\nfertilizer treated trees. Manure treatments had the highest percentages of dark green foliage trees appreciated by buyers.\r\nPoultry manure was as efficient as the mineral fertilizer. Considering fertilizers and operations costs, the application\r\nof poultry manure at the rate of 40 g N tree-1 /2 yrs seemed the one to be recommended to growers.",

The PCH\u00c3\u2014PTEC hybrid was the most productive, yielding 37%more than a Pinus elliottii local control and was 21 % superior to either parental species in DBH growth. PCH\u00c3\u2014POOC hybrid was, on average, 16 % superior to either parental species for DBH. Narrow-sense heritability estimates were low to moderate for growth traits (average of 0.27) and stem straightness (0.16). The estimated additive genetic cor- relations between growth traits and ages within traits were high (>0.8) and positive, providing confidence in early selec- tion based on diameter at breast height. The high proportion of estimated additive genetic variance compared to dominance variance in the F1 pine hybrids suggests that breeding strate- gies that maximize the use ofadditive genetic variance may be effective. The ranking ofthe 11 PCH parents based on general hybridizing ability predictions (estimated breeding values as hybrids) was somewhat inconsistent between PTEC and POOC hybrid crosses for all traits (r9d.f.=0.38\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.45; p \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc0.15\u00e2\u20ac\u201c0.25).

        "description": "Research Highlights: A transparent approach to developing a forest reference emissions level (FREL) adjusted to future local developments in Southern Cameroon is demonstrated. Background and Objectives: Countries with low historical deforestation can adjust their forest reference (emission) level (FREL/FRL) upwards for REDD+ to account for likely future developments. Many countries, however, find it difficult to establish a credible adjusted reference level. This article demonstrates the establishment of a FREL for southern Cameroon adjusted to societal megatrends of strong population\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand economic growth combined with rapid urbanization. It demonstrates what can be done with available information and data, but most importantly outlines pathways to further improve the quality of future FREL/FRL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in light of possibly accessing performance-based payments. Materials and Methods: The virtual FREL encompasses three main elements: Remotely sensed activity data; emission factors derived from the national forest inventory; and the adjustment of the reference level using a land use model of the agriculture sector. Sensitivity analysis is performed on all three elements using Monte Carlo methods. Results: Deforestation during the virtual reference period 2000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2015 is dominated by non-industrial agriculture (comprising both smallholders and local elites) and increases over time. The land use model projections are consistent with this trend, resulting in emissions that are on average 47% higher during the virtual performance period 2020\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2030 than during the reference period 2000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2015. Monte Carlo analysis points to the adjustment term as the main driver of uncertainty in the FREL calculation. Conclusions: The available data is suitable for constructing a FREL for periodic reporting to the UNFCCC. Enhanced coherence of input data notably for activity data and adjustment is needed to apply for a performance-based payment scheme. Expanding the accounting framework to include forest degradation and forest gain are further priorities requiring future research. View Full-Text\r\n",

        "description": "1. Architectural traits that determine the light captured in a given environment are an important aspect of the life\u00e2\u20ac\u0090history strategies of tropical tree species. In this study, we examined how interspecific variation in architectural traits is related to the functional traits of 45 coexisting tree species in Central Africa.\r\n2. At the tree level, we measured tree diameter, total height and crown dimensions for an average of 30 trees per species (range: 14\u00e2\u20ac\u201c72, total 968 trees) distributed over a large range of diameters (up to 162 cm). Using log\u00e2\u20ac\u201clog models, we fitted species\u00e2\u20ac\u0090specific allometric relationships between tree diameter, height and crown dimensions. At the species level, we derived architectural traits (height and crown dimensions) at 15 cm and maximum diameters from species\u00e2\u20ac\u0090specific allometries. The architectural traits were then related to functional traits, including light requirements, wood density, leaf habit and dispersal mode.\r\n3. Among the 45 coexisting tree species, we identified strong variations in height and crown allometries, along with architectural traits derived from these speciesspecific allometries. There was a positive correlation among architectural traits, suggesting that large\u00e2\u20ac\u0090statured canopy species were taller and had larger and deeper crowns than small\u00e2\u20ac\u0090statured understorey species at all ontogenic stages. The relationships between architectural and functional traits highlighted a continuum of species between the large\u00e2\u20ac\u0090statured canopy species and the small\u00e2\u20ac\u0090statured understorey species. In this moist and seasonal forest, large\u00e2\u20ac\u0090statured canopy species tended to be light\u00e2\u20ac\u0090demanding, wind\u00e2\u20ac\u0090dispersed, deciduous and large contributors to forest biomass (high basal area), while small\u00e2\u20ac\u0090statured understorey species tended to be shade\u00e2\u20ac\u0090tolerant, animal\u00e2\u20ac\u0090dispersed, evergreen and most abundant in terms of stem density.\r\n4.

        "description": "Tropical forests play a key role in regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate change by storing a large amount of carbon. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty about the amount and spatial variation of aboveground biomass (AGB), especially in the relatively less studied African tropical forests. In this study, we explore the local-scale variation and determinants of plot-level AGB, between and within two types of forests, the Celtis and Manilkara forests, growing under the same climate but on different geological substrates in the northern Republic of Congo. In each forest site, all trees \u00e2\u2030\u00a510 cm diameter were censured in 36\u00c3\u20141-ha plots and we measured tree height and crown size using a subsample of 18\u00c3\u20141-ha of these plots. We developed heightdiameter and crown-diameter allometric relationships and tested whether they differed between the two sites. For each 1-ha plot, we further estimated the AGB and calculated structural attributes (stem density and basal area), composition attributes (wood density) and architectural attributes (tree height and crown size), the latter\r\nbeing derived from site-specific allometric relationships. We found strong between-site differences in height-diameter and crown-diameter allometries. For a given diameter, trees were taller in the Celtis forest while they had larger crown in the Manilkara forest. Similar trends were found for the sixteen species present in both forest sites, suggesting an environmental control of tree allometry. Although there were some between-site differences\r\nin forest structure, composition and architecture, we did not detect any significant difference in mean AGB between the Celtis and the Manilkara forests. The AGB variation was related to the heterogeneous distribution of large trees, and influenced by basal area, height and crown dimensions, and to a lesser extent wood density. These forest attributes have strong practical implications on emerging remote-sensing technologies for carbon monitoring in tropical forests.",

        "description": "<p>Accurate height-diameter allometry is crucial for the estimation of forest biomass and carbon stocks. Tree height measurements over a large range of diameters and species are urgently needed in the tropics, specifically in central Africa, for the development of locally derived height-diameter allometric equations and the conversion of forest inventory data into biomass estimates, and for the validation of remotely sensed canopy height that mostly rely on a few specific field sites. In this study, we aimed to identify the variation in height-diameter allometry of tropical trees between forest types and among species in central Africa, and we examined the consequences for biomass estimation. Height and diameter were measured for a total of 521 trees over a large range of diameters in two forest types in southern Cameroon, 10&ndash;240 cm in the evergreen forest and 11&ndash;182 cm in the semi-deciduous forest. A total of ten allometric models including asymptotic and non-asymptotic models were fitted to the height-diameter data. Measured tree diameters, grouped into 10 cm wide diameter classes up to 150, from commercial forest inventory data (0.5 ha plots, n = 2101 and n = 5152, respectively in the evergreen and in the semi-deciduous forests) were converted into biomass estimates using general allometric models with and without including our site-specific height-diameter allometry. Though debated in the literature, our results supported a saturation of tree height with tree diameter both at site and species level, with asymptotic models better depicting the height-diameter allometry. Height-diameter allometry significantly differed between forest types and these local height-diameter equations also differed from published equations. For a given diameter, trees tended to be taller in the semi-deciduous forest than in the evergreen forest, as already reported between moist and wet forests in pantropical studies. Similar trends were reported within species for the three species shared by both forest types, suggesting an environmental control of tree allometry. Because of the low performance of the bioclimatic stress variable to predict tree height and of the slight soil differences between the two forest types, the environmental determinants of height-diameter allometry remain to be explored. In addition to tree allometry variation, structural differences (basal area and density) were also identified between the two forest types using commercial forest inventory data at genus level, and both allometry and forest structure (taller trees and denser stands) contributed to the greater biomass per hectare of the semi-deciduous forest.</p>",

These studies, based on three to four genes, sampled few taxa in each genus, and did not include the type of Rangaeris, nor did they take morphological variation into account. To delineate Ypsilopus more precisely, we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships of the genus and seven other closely related genera by analysing sequence variation at the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) and at five plastid markers (matK, rps16, trnC-petN intergenic spacer, trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, ycf1), from 42 specimens representing 36 taxa. Trees based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference confirm that two species of Tridactyle are nested with three Ypsilopus species, including the type of the latter, and two species of Rangaeris are grouped with this clade. Moreover, we examined morphological variation among all species belonging to these three genera, highlighting morphological features that characterize Ypsilopus, and we used these data to assign the two species of Tridactyle included in the molecular analyses, three other species of Tridactyle not included in the molecular analyses and two species of Rangaeris to Ypsilopus. New combinations for Tridactyle citrina, T. furcistipes, T. sarcodantha, T. tanneri, T. tricuspis, Rangaeris amaniensis and R. schliebenii in Ypsilopus are thus proposed, and one new section (i.e., Ypsilopus sect.

Species richness in the section is highest in Atlantic Central Africa\r\nand around the Albertine Rift. The new species, A. biteaui, is described and illustrated with line drawings. It most closely\r\nresembles A. aporoides in general aspect but differs in both foliar and floral characters, and is only known from lowland\r\nforests in Gabon.",

        "description": "Species delimitation within Angraecum section Dolabrifolia is problematic due to morphological variability coupled with overlap in many of the characters traditionally used to distinguish species. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies of the genus included three of the five currently described species of the Dolabrifolia group, placing them as sister to continental African species of Angraecum sect. Pectinaria. In preparation for a taxonomic\r\nrevision of section Dolabrifolia, we analyzed morphological and molecular data to re-assess the circumscription of each of the five currently described species, examined the\r\nrelationships among members of the section, and assessed their position within the genus. We used 172 alcohol-preserved specimens to perform multivariate analyses on 15\r\nmorphological characters. We also collected molecular sequence data from 16 taxa including all members of the section using six DNA regions, and analyzed these data with parsimony and Bayesian methods. The morphometric study revealed five distinct groups, of which four correspond to currently recognized species, while the fifth represents a taxonomic novelty. Angraecum podochiloides is the most distinctive morphologically, recognizable by its narrow leaves bearing white-yellowish flowers. The often confused species Angraecum distichum and Angraecum bancoense are clearly distinguishable by flower size. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that section Dolabrifolia forms a well-supported clade related to the\r\ncontinental African members of section Pectinaria. Four species are well delimited, while the accessions of Angraecum aporoides formed two well-supported clades corresponding to two subclusters revealed by the morphometric study. The recently published Angraecum poppendickianum is shown to be a synonym of A. distichum. ",

        "description": "<p>Despite significant progress made in recent years toward developing an infrafamilial classification of Orchidaceae, our understanding of relationships among and within tribal and subtribal groups of epidendroid orchids remains incomplete. To reassess generic delimitation among one group of these epidendroids, the African angraecoids, phylogenetic relationships were inferred from DNA sequence data from three regions, ITS, matK, and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, obtained from a broadly representative sample of taxa. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses yielded highly resolved trees that are in clear agreement and show significant support for many key clades within subtribe Angraecinae s.l. Angraecoid orchids comprise two well-supported clades: an African/American group and an Indian Ocean group. Molecular results also support many previously proposed relationships among genera, but also reveal some unexpected relationships. The genera Aerangis, Ancistrorhynchus, Bolusiella, Campylocentrum, Cyrtorchis, Dendrophylax, Eurychone, Microcoelia, Nephrangis, Podangis and Solenangis are all shown to be monophyletic, but Angraecopsis, Diaphananthe and Margelliantha are polyphyletic. Diaphananthe forms three well-supported clades, one of which might represent a new genus, and Rhipidoglossum is paraphyletic with respect to Cribbia and Rhaesteria, and also includes taxa currently assigned to Margelliantha. Tridactyle too is paraphyletic as Eggelingia is embedded within it. The large genus Angraecum is confirmed to be polyphyletic and several groups will have to be recognized as separate genera, including sections Dolabrifolia and Hadrangis. The recently segregated genus Pectinariella (previously recognized as A. sect. Pectinaria) is polyphyletic and its Continental African species will have to be removed. Similarly, some of the species recently transferred to that were previously Angraecoides placed in Angraecum sects. Afrangraecum and Conchoglossum will have to be moved and described as a new genus.</p>",

        "description": "We characterized the flowering patterns of 45 epiphytic orchid species occurring in Cameroonian rainforests to explore the environmental\r\nand evolutionary forces driving their phenology.We used a dataset of 3470 flowering events recorded over a period of 11 years\r\nin the Yaound\u00c3\u00a9 living collection (82% of the flowering events) and from in situ observations (18% of the flowering events) to (i)\r\ndescribe flowering frequency and timing and synchronization among taxa; (ii) test flowering patterns for phylogenetic relatedness at the\r\ngeneric level; and (iii) investigate the spatial patterns of phenology. An annual flowering pattern prevailed among the species selected\r\nfor this study. The species-rich African genera Angraecum and Polystachya are characterized by subannual and annual frequency\r\npatterns, respectively. However, in terms of flowering time, no phylogenetic signal was detected for the four most diverse genera\r\n(Ancistrorhynchus, Angraecum, Bulbophyllum, and Polystachya). Results suggest also an important role of photoperiod and precipitation\r\nas climatic triggers of flowering patterns. Moreover, 16% of the taxa cultivated ex situ, mostly Polystachya, showed significant\r\ndifferences in flowering time between individuals originating from distinct climatic regions, pointing toward the existence of phenological\r\necotypes. Phenological plasticity, suggested by the lack of synchronized flowering in spatially disjunct populations of\r\nPolystachya, could explain the widespread radiation of this genus throughout tropical Africa. Our study highlights the need to take\r\nthe spatial pattern of flowering time into account when interpreting phylogeographic patterns in central African rainforests.",

Using the species delimitation presented in the\r\nrecent taxonomic revision of the genus, this study aimed to confirm the monophyly of Bolusiella and assess the interspecific\r\nrelationships using a comprehensive sampling and various analytical methods. DNA sequences of one nuclear spacer region\r\n(ITS-1) and five plastid regions (matK, rps16, trnL\u00e2\u20ac\u201ctrnF, trnC\u00e2\u20ac\u201cpetN, and ycf1) from 20 specimens representing all five species\r\nof the genus were analyzed using static homology, dynamic homology, and Bayesian methods. The monophyly of both\r\nthe genus Bolusiella and each of its five species was confirmed, corroborating the previously published taxonomic revision.\r\nThe use of dynamic homology methods was not conclusive for this particular group. The results of the total evidence analysis\r\n(combining all six sequence regions) using the dynamic homology approach yielded a slightly different hypothesis regarding\r\ninterspecific relationships (namely the exchange of B. talbotii and Bolusiella iridifolia as the earliest diverging lineage),\r\nprobably because the nodes in question are supported by a small subset of conflicting characters, compared to the hypotheses\r\nresulting from the static homology and Bayesian methods, which are congruent with the results of previous studies.",

ConR (1) calculates key geographic range\r\nparameters (AOO and EOO) and estimates the number of locations sensu IUCN needed\r\nfor an assessment under criterion B; (2) uses this information in a batch process to\r\ngenerate preliminary assessments of multiple species; (3) summarize the parameters and preliminary assessments in a spreadsheet; and (4) provides a visualization of the\r\nresults by generating maps suitable for the submission of full assessments to the IUCN\r\nRed List.

This study aims to describe and infer the evolutionary history of this\r\nnovelty by using phylogenetics, biogeographic inference and dating estimation analyses.\r\nMethods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The new species was subject to a palynological, molecular phylogenetic and biogeographical\r\nanalysis. In addition, a thorough morphological comparison with its closely related species was conducted.\r\nKey results \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Morphological comparison and molecular phylogenetics corroborate its status as a new\r\nspecies, which is given the name Impatiens akomensis. Molecular data, based on ImpDEF1, ImpDEF2 and\r\nITS indicate that Impatiens akomensis is most closely related to the Cameroonian I. macroptera, whereas\r\nthe lineage towards I. macroptera and the novelty is sister to the Gabonese I. pseudomacroptera. Impatiens\r\nakomensis differs from I. macroptera and I. pseudomacroptera in having very strongly asymmetric white\r\nflowers, much thicker leaves, a narrowly elliptic leaf shape and a serrulate leaf margin, smaller lateral\r\nunited petals (23.1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c24.2 mm) and larger bracts (12\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 mm). The new species qualifies for endangered\r\nstatus under IUCN criteria B2 and probably B1.\r\nConclusions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Dating analyses in combination with biogeographic inference, and ecological and\r\nenvironmental interpretation of the novelty and its closely related species allows us to infer the putative\r\nevolutionary history of Impatiens akomensis.",

In this framework,\r\nbotanical exploration was conducted between 2007 and 2011 in various regions of Cameroon and resulted\r\nin the discovery of several new national records and new species.\r\nMethods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Normal practices of herbarium taxonomy have been applied.

        "description": "Background and aims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Recent molecular studies suggest the polyphyly of Angraecum and the\r\nunnaturalness of some of its sections, as exemplified by sect. Pectinaria, which has species in two wellseparated\r\nclades, one in Madagascar and the other in continental Africa. However, species delimitation\r\namong the five continental African members remained problematic due to morphological variability. In\r\npreparation for the taxonomic revision of this group, we used morphological and molecular data to re-assess\r\nthe circumscription of each species, and to evaluate their monophyly and relationships to one another.\r\nMethods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A total of 59 alcohol-preserved specimens were used to perform multivariate analyses on 37\r\nmorphological characters. DNA sequences from one nuclear (ITS-1) and five plastid regions (matK, rps16,\r\ntrnL\u00e2\u20ac\u201cF, trnC\u00e2\u20ac\u201cpetN and ycf1) were analyzed using Parsimony and Bayesian methods.\r\nKey results \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The morphometric study revealed five distinct morphospecies that correspond to the concepts\r\nof the currently recognized species. Angraecum doratophyllum and A. subulatum are the most distinct\r\nmorphologically, whereas A. atlanticum, A. gabonense and A. pungens are most similar to one another.\r\nPhylogenetic analyses using a combined data set of the six markers yielded highly resolved, congruent\r\ntrees with strong branch support. The polyphyly of A. sect. Pectinaria is confirmed, with continental\r\nAfrican members appearing to be most closely related to sect. Dolabrifolia, found exclusively in Africa.\r\nThe multiple accessions of A. doratophyllum, A. gabonense, A. pungens and A. subulatum each formed a\r\nwell-supported clade. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses placed A. atlanticum and A. pungens in a subclade\r\nwithin which samples of A. pungens were nested but those of A. atlanticum formed a grade. These two\r\nspecies can be easily distinguished morphologically by leaf dimensions and flower length, but broader\r\nsampling in continental Africa is needed to test whether individuals recognized as A. atlanticum might\r\nrepresent two distinct taxa.",

        "description": "The influence of functional traits on floristic patterns remains poorly understood\r\nin tropical rain forests. This contribution explores whether patterns of endemism of\r\nplant species are influenced by their life form and mode of dispersal. We used a comprehensive\r\ndataset of 3650 georeferenced plant specimens collected in Cameroon\r\nbelonging to 115 taxa of Orchidaceae and 207 Rubiaceae endemic to Atlantic Central\r\nAfrica. Species diversity of each family was compared using raw species richness (SR) and\r\nan index of species diversity (Sk) using subsampling procedure to correct for sampling bias.\r\nMeasures were compared at three scales (square grids of one half-degree and one-degree\r\nper side and ecoregions) and according to elevation and continentality gradients. Species\r\nsimilarity between grid cells was measured using the sample-size corrected NNESS index.\r\nFor both families, SR and Sk decreased along the continentality gradient. In forest habitats\r\nbelow 1500 m altitude, both Orchidaceae and Rubiaceae show similar endemism patterns, but they differ in intensity. At higher altitudes, Sk is higher for orchids due to the presence\r\nof endemic terrestrial taxa in grasslands, where the endemic Rubiaceae flora is rather poor.\r\nSubstantial endemism observed at the ecoregion level and turnover analysis supported the\r\nrole of the Sanaga River as a phytogeographical boundary. Similar endemism patterns were\r\nobserved in lowland forests for Orchidaceae and Rubiaceae, even though Orchidaceae are\r\nassumed to have better long distance dispersal capabilities. The dispersal ability of\r\nOrchidaceae could be limited by the need of specific mycorhizal fungi for seed\r\ngermination or host specificity for epiphytic orchids.",

        "description": "Despite its tremendous biodiversity, which results from a strong elevation\r\ngradient and high habitat diversity, the fl ora of the Mbam Minkom Hills (Cameroon) is poorly\r\ndocumented. Moreover, these hills have recently become an urgent and major challenge for\r\nconservationists because their proximity to the city of Yaound\u00c3\u00a9 has considerably increased\r\nhuman pressure on this area considered as the last main block of primary submontane forest\r\naround this city. As a consequence, the main objectives of this paper are to provide the fi rst\r\norchid account of the Mbam Minkom Hills, to document the ecology and the distribution of\r\nthese species and to highlight the importance of this family for the conservation of this threatened\r\necosystem. A total of 75 orchid taxa within 27 genera were found in the Mbam Minkom\r\nHills. Sixty-one (81%) were epiphytic, 11 (15%) were terrestrial and 3 (4%) were lithophytic.\r\nSix of them (8%), one Bulbophyllum, one Diaphananthe, one Polystachya, one Rhipidoglossum\r\nand two Stolzia are new taxa. Genera with the highest number of taxa were Polystachya\r\n(19 taxa) and Bulbophyllum (12 taxa). Polystachya carnosa is newly recorded for Cameroon.\r\nLowland forest (51 taxa) and inselbergs (29 taxa) are the two habitats with the highest species\r\nrichness. Species fl ower mainly between March and May and between July and September.\r\nThirty-four (45%) taxa were endemic or near endemic to the Guineo-Congolian regional centre\r\nof endemism, of which 14 (19%) were endemic to the Lower Guinean Domain. Moreover,\r\nBulbophyllum teretifolium, Bulbophyllum sp. nov., Cheirostylis divina var. ochyrae, Polystachya\r\nsp. nov. and Stolzia repens var. cleistogama are endemic to Cameroon.

        "description": "Abstract: This study was conducted to investigate the floristic composition of woody species in Lammo natural Forest, Tembaro woreda, Kembata-Tembaro zone, Southern Ethiopia. 52 quadrants, each with 20 m x 20 m (400 m2) were systematically laid to collect vegetation data along line transects at the distance of 60m from each other. Vegetation structures such as DBH, basal area, height, frequency, IVI, and Species population structure were computed. Specimens were collected, pressed, dried and taken to Ethiopian National Herbarium for identification. Data analysis was carried out using Shannon- Wiener Diversity index, Microsoft Excel, R-package, past and Sorensen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similarity index. 54 woody species belonging to 46 genera from 29 families were identified. The dominant family was Myrtaceae followed by Euphorbiaceae. The vegetation cluster classification resulted in three plant communities. Most of the species in the study area fall under middle diameter and height classes. The results of the population structure for the forest revealed the signs of some disturbances and hence some management and conservation practices need to be in place.\r\nKeywords: Basal Area, Community Classification, DBH, Floristic Composition",

        "description": "Non-wood forest products (NWFPs) can be defined as all goods and services for commercial, industrial and subsistence uses other than wood derived from forests and their biomass that are   sustainably extracted without changing their reproductive functions. These products are obtained either from fruits, seeds, leaves, barks, roots or as exudates. The importance of the non-wood forest products in terms of food and nutritional requirements are medicine, fodder for livestock, fiber, fertilizers, construction materials, cosmetic and cultural uses. The objectives of the study were to identify the main types and uses of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) and to assess their contribution in the income of the rural communities. About 100 households were chosen randomly and interviewed at Komya, Abuassal, Omkheirban and Boro villages in Bahr Alarab Locality in East Darfur State of Sudan. The questionnaire dealt with types of NWFPs, methods of collection, uses, processing, marketing, extension and developing. The descriptive statistical analysis of the data was carried out using SPSS software program and Chi- square Test. The result showed that the main types of non-wood forest products in the study area were the fruits of Nabag (Ziziphusspina-christi), Laloab (Balanites aegytiaca), Aradaib (Tamarindus indica), as well as exudates of Acacia senegal (Gum Arabic) and Acacia seyal (Gum Talha).Those products have multipurpose nutritional (82%), medicinal (88%) and commercial (90%) uses. Most of the people, particularly women, worked in the collecting (91%) and marketing (65%) processes besides agriculture. It was also found that the non-timber forest products had significant contribution to their income (71%). The result also showed that the shortage of water (70%) and lack of funding (91%) hindered the collection and marketing. Also the study showed that there was weakness in forest extension services. Urgent intervention to guide and help the locals to sustainable production, efficient uses and profitable marketing and value added were recommended. In that respect, also encouraging community and funding institutions such as Micro financing Fund and the Family Banks to establish cooperative societies regarding production and marketing of non-wood forest products is of vital importance.

        "description": "Despite increasing scientific understanding of the global environmental crisis, we struggle to adopt the policies science suggests would be effective. One of the reasons for that is the lack of inclusive engagement and dialogue among a wide range of different actors. Furthermore, there is a lack of consideration of differences between languages, worldviews and cultures. In this paper, we propose that engagement across the science-policy interface can be strengthened by being mindful of the breadth and depth of the diverse human-nature relations\r\nfound around the globe. By examining diverse conceptualizations of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nature\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in more than 60 languages, we identify three clusters: inclusive conceptualizations where humans are viewed as an integral component of nature; non-inclusive conceptualizations where humans are separate from nature; and deifying conceptualizations where nature is understood and experienced within a spiritual dimension.\r\nConsidering and respecting this rich repertoire of ways of describing, thinking about and relating to nature can help us communicate in ways that resonate across cultures and worldviews. This repertoire also provides a resource we can draw on when defining policies and sustainability scenarios for the future, offering opportunities for finding solutions to global environmental challenges.",

        "description": "In Egypt, significant emissions arise caused by rice straw burning on the field. The total amount produced yearly about three million Mg, essential nutrients and organic matter are lost. The combined energy and material utilizations of rice straw can realize an important contribution to climate protection and resource conservation.\r\nTo produce bio-ethanol from rice straw, there are four steps that should be taken: 1-Chop rice straw; 2-Mill rice straw; 3-Rice straw sterilization; and 4-Fermentation the milled rice straw in the fermenter using yeast micro-organism. The present investigation included; manufacture fermenter locally, using computer design software Version 4.0, and techno-economic\r\nstudy using three proposed fermenters scales (300, 600 and 900 litres capacity) at Central Laboratory for Agricultural Climate (CLAC), Dokki, Agricultural Research Center (ARC), Giza, Egypt. A cost-benefit analysis approach was calculated and total return for the three scenarios\r\nwas estimated for different percentages of ethanol extraction (15, 17 and 20%).\r\nThe obtained results indicated that, using fermenter 900 litres capacity (third scenario) for 20% of ethanol extraction was the economical and effective one to produce bio-ethanol appropriate for small growers; where profit value was USD 566. The net present value at\r\ndiscount rate (D.R) of 30% was estimated to be a positive value of USD 1.096. The benefit cost ratio (B/ C) at the same D.R. was estimated to be 1.22; and the internal rate of return\r\n(IRR) reached about 30%.",

A\r\nlarge portion of our agricultural cultivation is mainly accumulated in the Nile delta. As a result the agricultural cultivation is facing several challenges due to climate change impacts especially extreme climatic events. This leads to a significant drop in potato production consequently negative socio-economic impacts all over the country. The aim of this paper was to investigate the climate change impacts on one of Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top strategic crops, potato. It was found that assessing climate change impacts on potato cultivation at local level is required. Increasing losses in crop production and quality have been taking place due to climate change in Egypt. It is very useful to identify proper adaptation practices for mitigating climate change impacts in potato production. Decision makers in developing adaptation strategies for potato production in Egypt should be\r\nassisted.",

        "title": "Carbon Stocks of Coarse Woody Debris in Central African ",
        "description": "<p>Coarse Woody Debris (CWD; defined here as fallen and standing dead trees and tree branches) is a critical-structural and functional component of forest ecosystems that typically comprises a large proportion of total aboveground carbon storage. Coarse woody debris estimation for the tropics is uncommon, and little is known about how carbon storage in CWD will respond to climate change. Given the predominant role that tropical forests play in global carbon cycling, this information gap compromises efforts to forecast climate change impacts on terrestrial carbon balance. In this study, we aimed to identify the variation in Coarse Woody Debris (CWD) stocks between forest types (Old-growth and selective logging forests) and among the plots in Ipendja mixed lowland terra firme tropical rainforest (central Africa). The study also examined the consequence for CWD carbon stocks estimation. The study area is located in Ipendja forest management unit (UFA), close to Dongou district (Likouala Department), in Northern Republic of Congo. Data collection were done with eight rectangular plots, each 25 x 200 m (0.5 ha). The method of line intercepts sampling has been used in each studied site. A total number of 135 CWD samples of diameter \u00ef\u201a\u00b3 10 cm in the studied plots have been recorded. It was obvious that stocks of CWD in Mokelimwaekili (mean: 19.96 Mg ha-1; sum: 79.84 Mg ha-1) were higher than those of Sombo (mean: 8.9 Mg ha-1; sum: 35 Mg ha-1). There was a significance difference in Ipendja evergreen forest about CWD stocks across two forest types and studied plots. This finding suggests that values vary among forest types and that separate reference values should be adopted for estimates of undisturbed forest carbon stocks in the different ecosystems in Congo basin. Different reference values represent the variability of CWD among forest types and contribute to reducing uncertainties in current estimates of carbon stocks in central African forest ecosystems.</p>",

        "description": "Hydroponic is a subset of hydroculture, which is a method of growing plants\r\nwithout soil by instead using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent.\r\nThe study aimed to assess the behavior of Minetto and Blonde de Paris varieties\r\nof Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in hydroculture. The experiments tanks\r\nhave been installed in Talanga\u00c3\u00af Micro-garden site, located in Kimbanguiste\r\nChurch at Brazzaville. The lettuce seeds were sown in a nursery tank, and\r\nthen transplanted into 4 hydroponic production tanks, at the rate of 2 tanks\r\nper variety, with 20 stems per tank. Each tank has a volume of 62 l. During\r\nthe 47 days of the lettuce evolutionary cycle in the production tanks, nutrient\r\nsolutions were provided in two phases, namely the post-nursery and full\r\nproduction. About the post-nursery, 868 ml were added, i.e. 620 ml for the\r\nmacro solution and 248 ml for the micro solution. With regard to full production,\r\nthere was an addition of 2430.4 ml, at the rate of 1736 ml for the\r\nmacro solution and 694.4 ml for the micro solution. Statistical analysis has\r\nbeen made using SPSS v.18.0 and SigmaPlot v.10.0 softwares. Separations\r\nwere performed by Duncan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s multiple range tests. Differences at P < 0.05\r\nwere considered to be significant. The results showed that the total production\r\nwas a biomass of 12 kg, i.e. 7.6 kg for Minetto and 4.4 kg for Blonde de\r\nParis. This study allowed us to find that Minetto fared better compared to\r\nBlonde de Paris concerning the quantitative and qualitative production of the\r\nvegetable.",

        "title": "Characterization of Three Tomato Varieties in Organic Farming",
        "description": "Objectives: The study aims to:\r\n\r\n-          Characterize three varieties of tomatoes\r\n\r\n-          Compare the varieties\r\n\r\n-          Determine the timing of fruit maturity\r\n\r\n-          Determine the quality and quantity of fruits per variety\r\n\r\nThe experiments took place at Yarok 2000 an organic farm.\r\n\r\nHypothesis:\r\n\r\nThe students hypothesized that there would be significant differences between three varieties of tomatoes: 1. Cherry 1559, 2. Oval 1742 and 3. Cluster 1558.  The differences will be measured through the shape, size, color, quantity and quality of the fruits.\r\n\r\nMethodology:\r\n\r\n15 plants in total were selected for the experiment, 5 of each type. They were all planted inside a greenhouse where they were planted 60cm/40cm apart.\r\n\r\nData was collected every three days through monitoring and by recording observations of the parameters defined earlier.\r\n\r\nEconomic Importance:\r\n\r\nTomatoes have a very high consumption rate, particularly in developed countries. In Israel for example, the price of tomatoes can have a major effect on the Consumer Price Index.\r\n\r\nTomatoes have high nutritional values, including high levels of vitamin A and C. They are suited for different cropping systems and grow over short periods of time, meaning they can generate a good income for farmers throughout the year.\r\n\r\nConclusion and Recommendations:\r\n\r\nIt is important for the farmer to know which variety of tomato to grow depending on his preferences. The results showed that if a farmer wants a sweet variety, he should grow the cherry variety 1559, whilst if he wishes to grow large diameter fruit he should plant cluster variety 1558. If he is short in time and wants fruits that will mature early, the oval variety 1742 should be his choice.\r\n\r\nOverall, the oval and cluster tomato varieties recorded the highest yield whilst the cherry was the sweetest.\r\n\r\nThe students also make a point in recommending organic farming as was done on their farms for environmentally friendly farming that leads to wonderful quality in the crops.",

        "title": "A REVIEW OF PHYTOREMEDIATION AS A MEANS OF REDUCING HEAVY METAL CONTAMINATION OF THE MUSAKASHI STREAM; A CASE OF SEOB- NFCA MINE",
        "description": "Mining is one of the major economic drivers in Zambia. This is due to the presence of a large Copper belt in the North of Zambia. Many other minerals are found in traces and ores all over the country. The Copperbelt and North Western Provinces are the leading mining regions with several copper mines. Mining involves many operations from the surface down to the underground and some of the operations include blasting, shaft sinking, mine cooling, and Isa smelting. The discharge of heavy metals from the mines into the environment has become a serious issue today and it creates a negative environmental impact that can occur at a global, regional and local scale through direct and indirect activities. These heavy metals are released into the environment from uncontrolled emissions through smelt processes, electroplating and agriculture have contributed to the levels of heavy metal such as Cd, Co, Cr, Pd, Mn are known to harm the quality of soil and cause adverse effects to human health other organisms that come in contact with such soil or water. These contaminants can be remediated through Phytoremediation processes, particularly Rhizofilltration, Phytoextraction, and Phytostabilisation have been applied to metals contaminations containing (e.g. Ag, Cr, Fe, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo Ni, Pb, and Zn), metalloids, and radionuclides. Phytoremediation is bioremediation which involves the use of aquatic and terrestrial plants to remove, transfer, stabilize or destroy contaminants in the soil and groundwater. An integration of Constructed wetlands (CWs), Free-floating and Submerged and Emergent aquatic plants are the recommended methods of phytoremediation for water pollution treatment.",
